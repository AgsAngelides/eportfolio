		<br>
		<h3>Introduction to the module</h3>
        <p>The Secure Software Development modules aims to provide a detailed overview of programming languages and risks associated to those, from the perspectives of design and architecture approaches, programming paradigms. It will cover the subject of software testing and it will look into the impact the Operating Systems and Libraries have on software development. In addition to the programming languages, topics such as the distributed systems, APIs, future trends in secure software development, etc. will also be addressed.
		<br><br>
		In particular, this module will:
		<ul>
			<li>Introduce the concept of abstraction of programming.</li>
			<li>Develop an understand of the basic principles of secure software development methodologies.</li>
			<li>Explore how to perform analysis, program design, software construction and testing required for secure software development.</li>
			<li>Introduce the basic concepts of software architecture and Software Development Life Cycles such as Agile and TOGAF. </li>
			<li>Further develop team working skills.</li>
			<li>Provide an opportunity to reflect on personal development.</li>
		</ul>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The Unit 1 focusses on the review of various software developing methodologies. In this unit we have reviewed the Waterfall and Agile as well as Secure Agile software 
	development approaches as well as looked into the Unified Modelling Language (UML) and how this could support software development. During this week we have also touched upon the 
	subject of various software development standards applicable.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>For this discussion post I have chosen to analyse a vulnerability from the OWASP 2017 Top 10 Injection category (Mitre, 2017) – OS Command Injection.</p>
		<p>The OS Command Injection is a vulnerability concerned with an unauthorised person being allowed to execute commands directly on the operating system. This is usually 
		done via a third-party system, such as a web application, which uses certain commands to access the OS (Mitre, 2022).</p>
		<p>To visualise the actions taken by the development team and the attacker that could have led to an attack abusing this weakness, the Unified Modelling Language (UML) 
		Sequence diagram has been chosen. This type of diagram captures the process flow and interactions between different interacting parties (Seidl, 2015) and thus it was felt 
		that it was the most suitable UML diagram in this instance.</p>
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./secure software/unit 1/OS Command injection sequence diagram.png"></p>
		<p>The sequence presented in the Figure 1 reviews an OS Command Injection vulnerability example introduced by the usage of the Python OS module and, specifically, its 
		os.system() method. The web application uses this method to fetch the user’s email address entered in the front end, pass it to the OS and then to trigger an email to 
		the user.</p>
		<p>Using the os.system() method in Python on a web application may provide an attacker with an opportunity to inject malicious payload which could execute code remotely 
		(Turcsányi, 2022) on the webserver or download internal configuration files, as demonstrated in the example.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>During week 1 of the 'Secure software development' module we have been asked to complete a variety of reading, prepare a UML diagram on the assigned subject as well as 
		to write and sign a team contract for the newly allocated team.</p>
		<p>This week's reading material included an overview of the OWASP Top Ten (Mitre, 2017), the introduction into a new software development methodology called Secure Scrum (Pohl & Hof, 2015), 
		ISO 27000 standards (ISO/IEC, 2018), software design patterns (Asghar et al, 2019) and an introduction into software development using Python as well as security considerations 
		the developers must have when using this programming language (Pillai, 2017).</p>
		<p>I enjoyed how the authors of the Secure Scrum paper managed to utilise a currently popular software development approach for security related issue development work. The paper 
		not only discussed the theoretical benefits of such methodology, but also practical means of implementing it and provided some great examples to further explain their ideas.
		<br>
		I found this paper most relevant to my current role as the Project Manager/Business Analyst. Depending on the type of project, we may deliver some using the waterfall methodology and 
		others using the Agile methodology. When using the Waterfall, I always make sure that in the project design phase we cover the security aspects. However, when using the Agile method 
		I find that the security aspects are often missed during the many iterations or you start off with having them, but in the subsequent iterations you loose the sight of it. The suggestions 
		made in the paper on using the Security tags to tag to the issues in the iteration which then link to the security vulnerabilities is a great way of not loosing the track of the security 
		exposures and tracking them to completion along many sprints.</p>
		<p>The other reading material was interesting too, however, some of it was a little less relevant to my current job, although, still informative. </p>
		<p>The first module seminar we had this week was also very good and informative. The assignment requirements discussed by the tutor have cleared some things up for me. 
			We have also been advised we would be assigned to the teams of 3 to 4 people in which we will conduct all future assignments. I have also requested the tutor 
			to let us know if any seminar preparation must be done in teams going forward since it was not always clear in the previous module.</p>
		<p>During the Unit 1 we have also been asked to prepare an initial discussion forum post on a chosen OWASP Top 10 vulnerability (Mitre, 2017). The post had to include a Unified 
		Modelling Language (UML) diagram of our choice to best represent a chosen coding weakness and the steps that led to it occuring.<br>
		I have chosen to use the UML Sequence diagram, because I felt that this type of the diagram was most suitable to represent the actions flowing from one system/actor to the other. 
		The task was interesting since it made me think more of a particular vulnerability I chose from the list. It made me understand what coding practices and actions taken by the user 
		could lead towards exploiting this vulnerability. </p>
		<p>Lastly, in this unit we were assigned to our team and asked to create a team contract. It didn't take us long to get going, when compared to the previous 
			module with team work, as I think most of us already knew how to approach the team work in the online learning environment. During this week we have 
			also discussed the domain we wish to work on in our Unit 3 and 6 assignments as well as considered any other upcoming team tasks. A Google drive folder 
			was created for storing all the team related work and team meeting availability was also discussed. The team was very responsive and keen to get started.</p>

		<p>This week we had a variety of tasks to complete.</p>
		<p>We have been asked to identify security related actions/tasks which could be taken at each Scrum Agile software development phase. To help us out 
			with this task we have been given a paper to read (Sharma & Bawa, 2020). The task was quite straight forward and many of the security practices 
			that could be applied at every development stage was something we have adressed in the previous modules. From managing development projects using both 
			Agile and Waterfall methodologies, however, I know that there isn't one methodolgy/checklist that works for everyone. Having a security tasks 
			checklist, like the one discussed in the paper, is certainly useful, however, not all of these items will be relevant to every project. </p>
		<p>A blog post had to also be produced this week on how to manage the people in an organisation to reduce the security associated risks whilst also using 5 different terms 
		from the ISO/IEC standard 27000. I thought this was a good assignment, since, when doing the research for my blog post, I read quite a few different papers on the subject 
		of the user training and I have found some interesting statistics and suggestions on how to make the training more interesting, for example, using demonstrations. I am 
		looking at doing some Cyber security governance related tasks in my next role, and this information will be useful in my day to day job. </p>
