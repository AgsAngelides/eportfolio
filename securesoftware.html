	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The Unit 1 focusses on the review of various software developing methodologies. In this unit we have reviewed the Waterfall and Agile as well as Secure Agile software 
	development approaches as well as looked into the Unified Modelling Language (UML) and how this could support software development. During this week we have also touched upon the 
	subject of various software development standards applicable.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>For this discussion post I have chosen to analyse a vulnerability from the OWASP 2017 Top 10 Injection category (Mitre, 2017) – OS Command Injection.</p>
		<p>The OS Command Injection is a vulnerability concerned with an unauthorised person being allowed to execute commands directly on the operating system. This is usually 
		done via a third-party system, such as a web application, which uses certain commands to access the OS (Mitre, 2022).</p>
		<p>To visualise the actions taken by the development team and the attacker that could have led to an attack abusing this weakness, the Unified Modelling Language (UML) 
		Sequence diagram has been chosen. This type of diagram captures the process flow and interactions between different interacting parties (Seidl, 2015) and thus it was felt 
		that it was the most suitable UML diagram in this instance.</p>
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./secure software/unit 1/OS Command injection sequence diagram.png"></p>
		<p>The sequence presented in the Figure 1 reviews an OS Command Injection vulnerability example introduced by the usage of the Python OS module and, specifically, its 
		os.system() method. The web application uses this method to fetch the user’s email address entered in the front end, pass it to the OS and then to trigger an email to 
		the user.</p>
		<p>Using the os.system() method in Python on a web application may provide an attacker with an opportunity to inject malicious payload which could execute code remotely 
		(Turcsányi, 2022) on the webserver or download internal configuration files, as demonstrated in the example.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>During week 1 of the 'Secure software development' module we have been asked to complete a variety of reading, prepare a UML diagram on the assigned subject as well as 
		to write and sign a team contract for the newly allocated team.</p>
		<p>This week's reading material included an overview of the OWASP Top Ten (Mitre, 2017), the introduction into a new software development methodology called Secure Scrum (Pohl & Hof, 2015), 
		ISO 27000 standards (ISO/IEC, 2018), software design patterns (Asghar et al, 2019) and an introduction into software development using Python as well as security considerations 
		the developers must have when using this programming language (Pillai, 2017).</p>
		<p>I enjoyed how the authors of the Secure Scrum paper managed to utilise a currently popular software development approach for security related issue development work. The paper 
		not only discussed the theoretical benefits of such methodology, but also practical means of implementing it and provided some great examples to further explain their ideas.
		<br>
		I found this paper most relevant to my current role as the Project Manager/Business Analyst. Depending on the type of project, we may deliver some using the waterfall methodology and 
		others using the Agile methodology. When using the Waterfall, I always make sure that in the project design phase we cover the security aspects. However, when using the Agile method 
		I find that the security aspects are often missed during the many iterations or you start off with having them, but in the subsequent iterations you loose the sight of it. The suggestions 
		made in the paper on using the Security tags to tag to the issues in the iteration which then link to the security vulnerabilities is a great way of not loosing the track of the security 
		exposures and tracking them to completion along many sprints.</p>
		<p>The other reading material was interesting too, however, some of it was a little less relevant to my current job, although, still informative. </p>
		<p>The first module seminar we had this week was also very good and informative. The assignment requirements discussed by the tutor have cleared some things up for me. 
			We have also been advised we would be assigned to the teams of 3 to 4 people in which we will conduct all future assignments. I have also requested the tutor 
			to let us know if any seminar preparation must be done in teams going forward since it was not always clear in the previous module.</p>
		<p>During the Unit 1 we have also been asked to prepare an initial discussion forum post on a chosen OWASP Top 10 vulnerability (Mitre, 2017). The post had to include a Unified 
		Modelling Language (UML) diagram of our choice to best represent a chosen coding weakness and the steps that led to it occuring.<br>
		I have chosen to use the UML Sequence diagram, because I felt that this type of the diagram was most suitable to represent the actions flowing from one system/actor to the other. 
		The task was interesting since it made me think more of a particular vulnerability I chose from the list. It made me understand what coding practices and actions taken by the user 
		could lead towards exploiting this vulnerability. </p>
		<p>Lastly, in this unit we were assigned to our team and asked to create a team contract. It didn't take us long to get going, when compared to the previous 
			module with team work, as I think most of us already knew how to approach the team work in the online learning environment. During this week we have 
			also discussed the domain we wish to work on in our Unit 3 and 6 assignments as well as considered any other upcoming team tasks. A Google drive folder 
			was created for storing all the team related work and team meeting availability was also discussed. The team was very responsive and keen to get started.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>Three of us participated in our team meeting this week: me, Sherelle and Andrijana. Some were unable to join due to the time differences and so we will aim to schedule 
		the call next time at a more suitable time for everyone.</p>
		<p>During the team meeting we have discussed our Design document, progress made so far, the logic behind what we have done and decided on the following actions:
			<ul>
				<li>Add an activity diagram showing both login and registration processes instead of the current diagram. Andrijana will work on it.</li>
				<li>Add a sequence diagram demonstrating login and registration processes between various actors and systems. Ags will work on it.</li>
				<li>Add a class diagram demonstrating the obvious classes and attributes. Sherelle will work on it, however, everyone's input may be needed to ensure we include correct classes and attributes.</li>
				<li>We will continue working on the specific ways we could mitigate various OWASP vulnerabilities (keeping our system in mind the whole time, so we don't include generic recommendations). Andrijana will look into it this week, however, everyone else should contribute too where possible.</li>
				<li>Kevin will work on the system requirements and assumptions.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>We have also discussed that:
			<ul>
				<li>Where possible, references should come from academic sources, such as papers, journals and books. Google Scholar is a great database!</li>
				<li>We will all pick up the bits and pieces we see missing in the assignment. If there is an empty spot in the document, it's probably because we haven't done research on it yet and so everyone should feel free to add some points.</li>
				<li>Everyone should feel free to go in and add bits, move things about, remove things. In the end hopefully we will end up with something we are all sort of happy with.</li>
				<li>We should include in our conclusions things that we could improve and real life implementation considerations.</li>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>This week we had a variety of tasks to complete.</p>
		<p>We have been asked to identify security related actions/tasks which could be taken at each Scrum Agile software development phase. To help us out 
			with this task we have been given a paper to read (Sharma & Bawa, 2020). The task was quite straight forward and many of the security practices 
			that could be applied at every development stage was something we have adressed in the previous modules. From managing development projects using both 
			Agile and Waterfall methodologies, however, I know that there isn't one methodolgy/checklist that works for everyone. Having a security tasks 
			checklist, like the one discussed in the paper, is certainly useful, however, not all of these items will be relevant to every project. </p>
		<p>A blog post had to also be produced this week on how to manage the people in an organisation to reduce the security associated risks whilst also using 5 different terms 
		from the ISO/IEC standard 27000. I thought this was a good assignment, since, when doing the research for my blog post, I read quite a few different papers on the subject 
		of the user training and I have found some interesting statistics and suggestions on how to make the training more interesting, for example, using demonstrations. I am 
		looking at doing some Cyber security governance related tasks in my next role, and this information will be useful in my day to day job. </p>
		<p>This week we have also continued debating in the forum on the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and a few more people contributed their thoughts. My peer commented on the UML 
		sequence diagram produced by myself and suggested that I could have probably dropped the actor 'developer' since it was not necessary in demonstrating the vulnerability. I am 
		not sure if I agree with that, because, I wanted to show exactly how the vulnerability was introduced via the code, and I fel this was a good way of showing it. However, 
		perhaps more research on the UML diagrams and process representation could be useful in making sure that my diagrams are not ambiguous and clear.</p>
		<p>In this unit we have continued working in teams and we have found out that we will now be a team of 6 rather than a team of 4. This was because quite a few peers 
		dropped out of the module as they did not wish to double up on the modules and so we all ended up being in the same team.</p>
		<p>Working in such a large team is not without its difficulties. The communication is more difficult as some people do not always respond. However, if a person or a couple 
		of persons are not contributing, it is less noticeable since you have a few other team members to fall back on.
		<br>
		Having a larger team also helps with assignments where some members do not have as much knowledge. Everyone then covers different assignment aspects which cover everyone's skills 
		base.</p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>In the Unit 3 we have looked into the various programming languages and their history, programming paradigms, methods, security issues related to poor programming practices. 
	We have investigated the language concepts using Python as an example and looked into the best practices and methods to be used in making the code more secure. We have been

		<div class="content">
		<p>In this unit we have been given a quick coding practice. We have been asked to run a code in C programing language which doesn't validate user's input and thus presents 
		a buffer overflow error if the input exceeds allowed length, and then asked to run a similar code in Python, which also triggers a buffer overflow error, just differently. 
		Then, asked to use Pylint linter in testing the Python code and analysing the results.</p>
		<p>The screenshots below presents what the Python code looked like when Pylint library was called and executed on the file containing the Python code as well as what the 
		scan results looked like.</p>
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./secure software/unit 3/python overflow.PNG">
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./secure software/unit 3/pylint scan.PNG">
		<p>I then used the errors provided by Pylint and looked them up in the guidance documentation available for this library and I was able to resolve the errors; please see the 
		screenshot below of the updated code (the code file name also had to be updated to use lower case letters to adhere to Python's naming convention).</p>
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./secure software/unit 3/correctly written code.PNG">
		<p>Interesting point here is that Pylint has made sure that the code meets the Python language standards, however, the buffer overflow issue created by range of 14 exceeding the 
		array range of 10 has not been resolved. So the code still has security issues which can be picked up by the users testing boundaries and fixed by visual code inspection.</p>

		<p>We have not had many team discussions on this subject, however, me and Andrijana seem to share the same views: Python is potentially just as secure coding language

		</p>
		<h3>System Requirements & Assumptions</h3>
		<p>To meet the needs of the Dutch Police Internet Forensics, the system design should incorporate the following:
			<ul>
				<li>System will act as an evidence repository for primarily unstructured data related to forensic investigations (Kebande et. al., 2021).</li>
				<li>As of 2013, the organisation had 9,500 staff (Hillenius, Gijs, 2013). The system may additionally need to be accessed by other law enforcement organisations.</li>
				<li>The system must meet all applicable privacy and security regulations (e.g., GDPR).</li>
				<li>The system should implement Forensics as a Service (FaaS) to take advantage of cloud-based, elastic CPU and storage capabilities (Nanda & Hansen, 2016).</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Design Decisions, Tools, and Libraries</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>Python 3.10 and Django 4.0.5 open-source framework (Ghimire, 2020) will be used.</li>
				<li>Djago’s serverless SQL database SQLite is to be utilised (Tiwari et. al., 2019). See Appendix A.</li>
				<li>Passwords will be hashed and salted using SHA512 and the Python Secrets module for generating a secure random salt (Al Farawn et. al., 2019). The hash will be iterated 100 times to increase unhashing time (Ji et. al., 2017). Database to store salted hash passwords.</li>

		<h3>Architectural and design patterns, SDLC approaches</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Django MVT pattern to be used for the request routing separation from the user interface (Holovaty & Kaplan-Moss, 2009).</li>
				<li>Object oriented paradigm will be implemented to construct code elements (Rumbaugh et. al., 2003).</li>
				<li>A secure Scrum SDLC will be used:
					<ul>
						<li>Requirements/Design phases to include security requirements.</li>
						<li>Implementation stage backlog to include security issues.</li>
						<li>Verification phase to cover security testing (Maier et. al., 2017).</li>
					</ul>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>
		<p>This design document includes system requirements and assumptions for a prototype of the Dutch Police Internet Forensics web application. Security challenges alongside 
		mitigation techniques are identified and highlighted in Table 1. The web application will use these techniques to mitigate its potential vulnerabilities. Design decisions 
		are related to the production of the prototype and certain aspects of the design must be revisited before releasing the application to the public.</p>

		<p>In this unit we have been asked to read a few papers and a few more chapters from the book by Pillai (2017). </p>
		<p>The book by Pillai continued looking into various software/application design patterns and architecture. This was an extension on what we had already learned from our 
		lecturecast. The chapters were extremelly helpful for our assignment, since within this assignment we must choose paradigms, patterns and architecture we will be implementing.</p>
		<p>We have also read a paper by Ferrer et al. (2012) on how the complexity of software testing could be estimated to predict the amount of test cases needed. Whilst I do see a benefit 
		of this estimation when planning the overall project delivery and needing to know how long could a testing phase take, I do not see project managers implementing this menthod 
		themselves, due to its complexity. If it was automated and incorporated in one of the other known project management tools, then potentially, this could be a great addition to the 
		project manager's toolkit.</p>
		<p>Another paper we looked at (Shepperd, 1988) critiqued Cyclomatic approach to analysing the software complexity. The author has pointed many shortcomings of this approach which 
		is often cited in other research papers, such as the difficulty of being able to split the software into the components or the difficulty of listing out all the potential 
		paths within the software, which are necessary in the complexity analysis. Based on this, it appears to be a model betters suited for science world, rather than a business project 
		management. This metric is complex to measure and also not very straigt forward due to many intepretations available, which makes it unsuitable for using it in the real life scenarios.</p>
		<p>We have also learnt more on all types of software testing and the testing worklof (ISO/IEC/IEEE, 2015) which will be very useful before submitting our completed web application in 
		the unit 6.</p>
		<p>This week we have continued working on our design document due by the end of week 3. The assignment is coming along nicely and most peers are making contributions. We are continuing 
		to communicate both on the emails and whatsapp and we are schedulling team meetings to discuss pressing topics in person.</p>
		<p>We also had to prepare for the seminar as a team. Whilst I have completed my individual preparation which was then meant to be discussed with the remaining team members, 
		the rest of the team did not submit their work. With some peers doubling up on the modules, non - scored assignments may not be a priority.</p>
