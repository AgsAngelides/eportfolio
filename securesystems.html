		<h3>Introduction to the module</h3>
		<p>This module aims to introduce the concepts and principles of the Secure Systems Architecture (SSA) and it involves an introduction into basic architecture of modern 
		operating systems, the relationship between it and the Distributed systems, secure system coding practices, the role of virtualisation in SSA.
		<br>
		We will also look into the current and future architecture challenges, limitations and opportunities.</p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The aim of unit 1 is to introduce us to the processes, threads and schedulles as well as the distributed systems. We are also going to be learning how to set up and use OS 
	containers (e.g. Dockers).</p>
	
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Coding activity</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>I was unable to install the Docker using the guidance provided by the university. The .io file appears to be an older Docker version so I used 
			docker-ce instead which appeared to work better. The installation guidance provided by the uservisity did not work and got hung at one point.</p>
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./secure systems/unit 1/image 1.png">
		<p>After a while, debian based VM would not work, so I restarted my work, and installed a Ubuntu on my Virtual box and then used an article by Parveez (2022) 
			to guide me through docker installation and testing on Ubuntu.</p>
		<p>I then tried to follow the link to the page provided to learn how to use containers for Python code, however, I found the instructions very unclear. 
			It was not clearly stated how exactly to build the dockerfile nor how to run it. All that prior knowledge was assumed to already exist by the 
			recommended page Author.</p>
		<p>After watching some more videos on youtube on how to set up a Docker file, I was able to create a docker file using the university provided link and 
			run it.</p>
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./secure systems/unit 1/image 2.png">
		<p>When trying to run the docker container, the requirements file as per the link provided by the university appears to also contain an incorrect Flask 
			version which no longer supports 'Escape' module, so I also needed to update the requirements of the docker contaner to use flask 2.1.0 rather 
			than 1.1.1.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>For this post I have chosen to create an ADTree analysing the home router vulnerabilities (see Figure 1). Because of the growing interest in smart homes and constantly expanding IoT, the home router security has become very important (Ray & Bagwari, 2020).</p>
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./secure systems/unit 1/Home_router.png">
		<p>The list of vulnerabilities in Figure 1 has been prepared by conducting qualitative research of various recently reported home router security vulnerabilities, however, it should be noted that the this list does not encompass all potential security risks (Kost, 2022; Horowitz, 2014; Avast, 2022; Wagenseil, 2022).</p>
		<p>To analyse these risks quantitively, the Attributes Domain functionality provided by the ADTree tool was used, namely, the ‘Probability of success’ option, which was chosen due to being able of providing an estimated view over the likelihood of the event happening.</p>
		<p>Each leaf with yellow background relevant to the attacker was manually assigned an estimated value as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>1 – the attack does not require experience, very easy to carry it out.</li>
				<li>0.5 – the attack can be carried out by inexperienced attacker.</li>
				<li>0 – the attack can be carried out by experienced attackers; unlikely to impact home network.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Similarly, each countermeasure (square green boxes in Figure 1) has also been manually assigned a value based on how easy/difficult it is to implement the measure:
			<ul>
				<li>1 – very easy to implement; no computing/networks experience is needed.</li>
				<li>0.5 – some computing experience or access is needed.</li>
				<li>0 - very difficult for an average home user to implement.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>In the latter evaluation, the user computer skill research in rich countries (Nielsen, 2016) was used to determine the value to assign: the study suggests that only 5% of adult papulation can define a problem and use tools for this problem’s resolution.</p>
		<p>The ADTree tool then calculated the resulting overall probability of success for abusing the home router based on the vulnerabilities and countermeasures identified.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>This unit's reading included and acrticle on the problems experienced by the distributed systems (Garcia-Valls et al, 2017), a paper on the 
			evolution of distributed systems (Salah et al, 2016), a paper on walware analysys collected over 5 years (Lever et al, 2017) and the chapters 
			2, 4, 5 and 7 of the Architectural Transformations in Network Services and Distributed Systems book (Luntovskyy & Spillner, 2017).</p>
		<p>I have enjoyed finding more about the distributed systems problems, especially since it is becoming a new norm. Also, many of the issues 
			mentioned by the authors are applicable to other systems, such as: sharing bugs in a timely fashion, responding quick, etc.</p>
		<p>The paper on the distributed systems evolution was very informative too and it provided a good comparison between SOAs, microservices, client-server 
			based systems, etc. as well as a good overvie of the potential issues faced by the microservices. This paper also expanded well on the unit's
			lecturecast material.</p>
		<p>The paper analysing various mawlare types and their occurences was particularly interesting, since it has provided an insight into the domain blackilisting 
			usefullness, i.e. that it was not likely to cover malicious domains used by the current malware due to the delay of the domain being discovered as 
			malicious and being reported. Additionally, it provided an overview of how wide spread the malware introduced by Potentialy Unwated Programs (PUPs) is 
			on even some very well known domains such as Amazon.co.uk and that potentially, there is a need to have PUP related security policies. </p>
		<p>In addition to the reading, we also had to submit an initial forum discussion post, complete a group contract and complete a coding activity.</p>
		<p>The coding activity involved us familiriasing ourselves with the Dockers and how the Python rest API code can be placed inside it. I struggled with this task: all 
		instructions have been provided for a Linux user. This meant that I had to install a Linux based VM (I chosen Ubuntu), then set it up, finally install the Docker and 
		test it against the flask rest api examples given. I had to do a lot of additional research to get going and spent a lot more time than suggested within the module. 
		In addition, some links within the module provided outdated information, which again, had to be further researched.
		<br>
		I think the module is perhaps not update every year which results in discprencies. Also, I do not think that this material was inexperienced user friendly.
		<br>
		That said, I got there in the end and learned more about Dockers.</p>
		<p>For the initial discussion forum post I had to prepare an ADTree using the ADTree tool, then analyse it using one of the ADTree attributes.
		<br>
		As before with the coding activity, I struggled slightly trying to work out how to use it all. The ADTree tool must be run with Java, which is not specified, so it must be 
		downloaded first. Additionally, the link to the user guide does not provide enough guidance on the domain attributes within the ADTree tool and also suggest reading two papers 
		to familiriase with the tool, but the information on the papers is missing.
		<br>
		I have completed a lot of my own research, looked at many examples, and I think I managed to complete a post. I am looking forward to my peer feedback (and hopefully tutor's) 
		in the following unit to find the mistakes I did and make sure that I use it currently in the Unit 3 assigment.</p>
		<p>This week we have also chosen our teams we will work with on delivering the assignments. Our team from the secure software development has decided to continue working 
		together on this module too. We were able to very quickly distribute all the tasks to everyone for the first assignment and made a very good progress on researching the 
		smart home device and controller hub vulnerabilities. Everyone was responsive and contributing. </p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>In this unit we aim to discuss how the monolith architecture could be evolved into microservices, create a flowchart using UML or SysML and to implement sockets to support 
	distributed computing using Python, with a client enabled in one process and a server enabled on the other.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>This week's reading include multiple materials on UML and SysML modeling languages and its best practices (Friedenthal et al, 2015; Ahmad et al, 2019; Finance. 2019). We have also read more about breaking down 
		monoliths into microservices and its best practices (Fowler, 2018; Kharenko, 2015).</p>
		<p>We have covered a variety of reading materials on the UML in the previous modules as well as having to prepare various diagrams, so I was familiar with how to use this 
		particular language and the Visual Paradigm software. The SysML, on the other hand, was a new language I have not come across before and it was interesting getting to know 
		how this is used by the System Engineers and the slight differences between this language and the UML.</p>
		<p>Regarding the monolithic architecture vs microservices, this is something we have also touched upon previously, however, in not so much detail. The papers provided some 
		great insight into the work and assessments required to be able to cary out this tasks, and when it is perhaps not necessary.</p>
		<p>In addition to the reading, this week we have also continued working as a team on the design document and the codio exercises.</p>
		<p>Our team, having worked before, was able to complete the document over a week early and submit it. Everyone made their contributions. I took upon myself to research the 
		vulnerabilities related to the controller hubs and its mitigations, to format the document, manage the team work and I was also the one who prepared the ADTree diagrams needed 
		for this assignment.</p>
