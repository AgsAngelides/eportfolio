		<br>
		<h3>Introduction to the module</h3>
		<p>This module aims to introduce the concepts and principles of the Secure Systems Architecture (SSA) and it involves an introduction into basic architecture of modern 
		operating systems, the relationship between it and the Distributed systems, secure system coding practices, the role of virtualisation in SSA.
		<br>
		We will also look into the current and future architecture challenges, limitations and opportunities.</p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The aim of unit 1 is to introduce us to the processes, threads and schedulles as well as the distributed systems. We are also going to be learning how to set up and use OS 
	containers (e.g. Dockers).</p>
	
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Coding activity</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>I was unable to install the Docker using the guidance provided by the university. The .io file appears to be an older Docker version so I used 
			docker-ce instead which appeared to work better. The installation guidance provided by the uservisity did not work and got hung at one point.</p>
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./secure systems/unit 1/image 1.png">
		<p>After a while, debian based VM would not work, so I restarted my work, and installed a Ubuntu on my Virtual box and then used an article by Parveez (2022) 
			to guide me through docker installation and testing on Ubuntu.</p>
		<p>I then tried to follow the link to the page provided to learn how to use containers for Python code, however, I found the instructions very unclear. 
			It was not clearly stated how exactly to build the dockerfile nor how to run it. All that prior knowledge was assumed to already exist by the 
			recommended page Author.</p>
		<p>After watching some more videos on youtube on how to set up a Docker file, I was able to create a docker file using the university provided link and 
			run it.</p>
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./secure systems/unit 1/image 2.png">
		<p>When trying to run the docker container, the requirements file as per the link provided by the university appears to also contain an incorrect Flask 
			version which no longer supports 'Escape' module, so I also needed to update the requirements of the docker contaner to use flask 2.1.0 rather 
			than 1.1.1.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>For this post I have chosen to create an ADTree analysing the home router vulnerabilities (see Figure 1). Because of the growing interest in smart homes and constantly expanding IoT, the home router security has become very important (Ray & Bagwari, 2020).</p>
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./secure systems/unit 1/Home_router.png">
		<p>The list of vulnerabilities in Figure 1 has been prepared by conducting qualitative research of various recently reported home router security vulnerabilities, however, it should be noted that the this list does not encompass all potential security risks (Kost, 2022; Horowitz, 2014; Avast, 2022; Wagenseil, 2022).</p>
		<p>To analyse these risks quantitively, the Attributes Domain functionality provided by the ADTree tool was used, namely, the ‘Probability of success’ option, which was chosen due to being able of providing an estimated view over the likelihood of the event happening.</p>
		<p>Each leaf with yellow background relevant to the attacker was manually assigned an estimated value as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>1 – the attack does not require experience, very easy to carry it out.</li>
				<li>0.5 – the attack can be carried out by inexperienced attacker.</li>
				<li>0 – the attack can be carried out by experienced attackers; unlikely to impact home network.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Similarly, each countermeasure (square green boxes in Figure 1) has also been manually assigned a value based on how easy/difficult it is to implement the measure:
			<ul>
				<li>1 – very easy to implement; no computing/networks experience is needed.</li>
				<li>0.5 – some computing experience or access is needed.</li>
				<li>0 - very difficult for an average home user to implement.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>In the latter evaluation, the user computer skill research in rich countries (Nielsen, 2016) was used to determine the value to assign: the study suggests that only 5% of adult papulation can define a problem and use tools for this problem’s resolution.</p>
		<p>The ADTree tool then calculated the resulting overall probability of success for abusing the home router based on the vulnerabilities and countermeasures identified.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>This unit's reading included and acrticle on the problems experienced by the distributed systems (Garcia-Valls et al, 2017), a paper on the 
			evolution of distributed systems (Salah et al, 2016), a paper on walware analysys collected over 5 years (Lever et al, 2017) and the chapters 
			2, 4, 5 and 7 of the Architectural Transformations in Network Services and Distributed Systems book (Luntovskyy & Spillner, 2017).</p>
		<p>I have enjoyed finding more about the distributed systems problems, especially since it is becoming a new norm. Also, many of the issues 
			mentioned by the authors are applicable to other systems, such as: sharing bugs in a timely fashion, responding quick, etc.</p>
		<p>The paper on the distributed systems evolution was very informative too and it provided a good comparison between SOAs, microservices, client-server 
			based systems, etc. as well as a good overvie of the potential issues faced by the microservices. This paper also expanded well on the unit's
			lecturecast material.</p>
		<p>The paper analysing various mawlare types and their occurences was particularly interesting, since it has provided an insight into the domain blackilisting 
			usefullness, i.e. that it was not likely to cover malicious domains used by the current malware due to the delay of the domain being discovered as 
			malicious and being reported. Additionally, it provided an overview of how wide spread the malware introduced by Potentialy Unwated Programs (PUPs) is 
			on even some very well known domains such as Amazon.co.uk and that potentially, there is a need to have PUP related security policies. </p>
		<p>In addition to the reading, we also had to submit an initial forum discussion post, complete a group contract and complete a coding activity.</p>
		<p>The coding activity involved us familiriasing ourselves with the Dockers and how the Python rest API code can be placed inside it. I struggled with this task: all 
		instructions have been provided for a Linux user. This meant that I had to install a Linux based VM (I chosen Ubuntu), then set it up, finally install the Docker and 
		test it against the flask rest api examples given. I had to do a lot of additional research to get going and spent a lot more time than suggested within the module. 
		In addition, some links within the module provided outdated information, which again, had to be further researched.
		<br>
		I think the module is perhaps not update every year which results in discprencies. Also, I do not think that this material was inexperienced user friendly.
		<br>
		That said, I got there in the end and learned more about Dockers.</p>
		<p>For the initial discussion forum post I had to prepare an ADTree using the ADTree tool, then analyse it using one of the ADTree attributes.
		<br>
		As before with the coding activity, I struggled slightly trying to work out how to use it all. The ADTree tool must be run with Java, which is not specified, so it must be 
		downloaded first. Additionally, the link to the user guide does not provide enough guidance on the domain attributes within the ADTree tool and also suggest reading two papers 
		to familiriase with the tool, but the information on the papers is missing.
		<br>
		I have completed a lot of my own research, looked at many examples, and I think I managed to complete a post. I am looking forward to my peer feedback (and hopefully tutor's) 
		in the following unit to find the mistakes I did and make sure that I use it currently in the Unit 3 assigment.</p>
		<p>This week we have also chosen our teams we will work with on delivering the assignments. Our team from the secure software development has decided to continue working 
		together on this module too. We were able to very quickly distribute all the tasks to everyone for the first assignment and made a very good progress on researching the 
		smart home device and controller hub vulnerabilities. Everyone was responsive and contributing. </p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>In this unit we aim to discuss how the monolith architecture could be evolved into microservices, create a flowchart using UML or SysML and to implement sockets to support 
	distributed computing using Python, with a client enabled in one process and a server enabled on the other.</p>
	
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Codio activity</b></button>

		<p>We have been asked to set up two servers, one for client and one for client echo using python scripts provided and then run them so they cant talk to each other. 
		Scripts of the two servers as well as their responses on the terminal can be seen below.</p>

		<p><b>Question 1</b>
		<br>
		In relation to echo-server.py, what is achieved using the command: s.bind((HOST, PORT))?
		</p>
		<p>The bind() function is a Python method used to assign an IP address and a port number to a socket instance. We have specified two variables in the python script, 
		one for the host (localhost) and one for the port (a non priviledged port). So this bind method is associating the socket we have created with the specified network 
		interface and a port number.
		</p>
		<p><b>Question 2</b>
		<br>
		In relation to echo-server.py, what is achieved using the command: s.connect((HOST, PORT))?

		<p>This week's reading include multiple materials on UML and SysML modeling languages and its best practices (Friedenthal et al, 2015; Ahmad et al, 2019; Finance. 2019). We have also read more about breaking down 
		monoliths into microservices and its best practices (Fowler, 2018; Kharenko, 2015).</p>
		<p>We have covered a variety of reading materials on the UML in the previous modules as well as having to prepare various diagrams, so I was familiar with how to use this 
		particular language and the Visual Paradigm software. The SysML, on the other hand, was a new language I have not come across before and it was interesting getting to know 
		how this is used by the System Engineers and the slight differences between this language and the UML.</p>
		<p>Regarding the monolithic architecture vs microservices, this is something we have also touched upon previously, however, in not so much detail. The papers provided some 
		great insight into the work and assessments required to be able to cary out this tasks, and when it is perhaps not necessary.</p>
		<p>In addition to the reading, this week we have also continued working as a team on the design document and the codio exercises.</p>
		<p>Our team, having worked before, was able to complete the document over a week early and submit it. Everyone made their contributions. I took upon myself to research the 
		vulnerabilities related to the controller hubs and its mitigations, to format the document, manage the team work and I was also the one who prepared the ADTree diagrams needed 
		for this assignment.</p>
		<p>The codio activity required us to generate a client and server sockets and connect them on the same machine, so that one is listening and another one is sending a signal. 
		The task was straightforward and the guidance provided by the university for it was easy to follow. I think this will be useful when completing our assignment in the unit 6.</p>

		<p><b>Task A:</b> Download the open-source SysML modelling tool Modelio to create a system diagram. For example, Modelio. The use of such tools ensures that the correct 
		UML notation is applied so that all developers can understand the representation.</p>
		<p>Instead of using the Modelio software which was a very large file, I used Visual Paradigm SysML diagrams available on their online platform. I found this tool to be a lot 
		more user friendly. </p>
		<p><b>Task B:</b> According to SysML.org, “SysML is a dialect of UML 2, and is defined as a UML 2 Profile.” Create a list of the differences between SysML and UML, based

				<li>SysML has modified the following UML diagrams: Class diagram, Composite diagrams.</li>
				<li>The following UML diagrams are not modified in the SysML: Use Case, Sequence, State Machine diagrams.</li>
				<li>The classes have been renamed to blocks in some of the diagrams.</li>
				<li>SysML language is smaller than UML: there are 9 constructs in sysML vs 13 in UML.</li>
				<li>SysML has added lightweight syntax and semantics for physical item flows.</li>

				<li>How has your AD tree model affected your design?

					The AD Tree model has flagged up some constraints we need to be aware of, such as noisy environments may be detrimental to the smart home performance and lock batteries.
				</li>
				<li>Investigate the available modules – look in particular at the constraints option. How could this be useful in creating a system design?
					<br>
					Constraints could be useful when trying to find out any points of the new system you are building that may impact the system design. Also, constraints can be 
					split out into its components, sub-components, etc, allowing to reuse the same constraints on different systems for a detailed overview.

		<p>This week's reading included multiple papers on the CIA triad and its modified versions so it covers all applicable cyber threats (Fenrich, 2008; Samonas & Coss, 2014), 
		paper on the MQTT and its adapted more secure version (Massad & Alsaify, 2020) and a paper on a smart home in the box called CASAS (Cook et al, 2002). A paper on voice recognition 
		technologies was also included (Alexakis, 2019).</p>
		<p>I have previously read various papers on the CIA triad and its various adaptions, so I found these papers a good memory refresher. The papers on the MQTTsec, CASAS and voice 
		recognition I found particularly relevant to our upcoming unit 6 assignment.</p>
		<p>The unit 6 assignment requires us to produce a prototype of a smart home system where one container is a a smart device and the other container is our controller hub. I was doing 
		research the other day on the best protocol to use and how we could make the control hub controls more real life like, and both MQTT and the python voice recognition libraries came up. 
		So the reading material this week has provided me with some good ideas on how we can address our assignment and its design.</p>
		<p>This week we also had to prepare for next week's seminar for which we had to design our smart home prototype using the sysML diagram and an open source tool. I found the 
		tasks difficult just because none of the educational material for it was very straight forward. They would define what each diagram was and the differences between the UML modelling 
		language and SysML, but when it came to actual practical guidelines, it was very difficult to find any that would guide someone with zero experience through.</p>

		There are a variety of protocols that are currently used to support communications between the IoT devices which often have limited memory and battery, use low end 
		microcontrollers and so there is a need for better more lightweight network protocols (Lin & Bergmann, 2016).</p>
		<p>6LoWPAN is a lightweight open standard network protocol defined by the Internet Engineering task force and it provides a way of carrying data packets in the form of 
		IPv6 over IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networks, which in turn permits direct connectivity to a wide variety of networks and the internet (Seliem & Elgazzar, 2018).</p>
		<p>This protocol uses a strong AES-128 encryption mechanism (Glissa & Meddeb, 2019), it compresses the protocol stack headers, enables stateless addressing, provides 
		consistency with the upper layers (Hennebert & Santos, 2014).</p>
		<p>Since the protocol operates over the IEEE 802.15.4, it benefits from this wireless networks data encryption and authentication (Hennebert & Santos, 2014).</p>
		<p>That said, some additional security measures are required to ensure the end-to-end security. This could be done by implementing a compressed IPsec network layer protocol
		developed specifically for 6LoWPAN to ensure data is secure when being transmitted over the network (Hennebert & Santos, 2014).</p>
		<p>In addition, an application layer protocol MQTT (which is compatible with 6LoWPAN) could be used to provide a reliable, secured multicast TLS/SSL security. It 
		allows many messages to be transmitted and does not consume a lot of power which supports the Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability principles (Biju & Shekokar, 
		2017).</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Initial discussion forum post - breaking down the monoliths</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>With the podcasts becoming more popular, Software as a Service (SaaS) podcast applications have seen a large increase in their user base (Bate, 2020) over the last 
		few years. Since many smaller companies tend to use a monolithic architecture (Kwiecen, 2022), it is safe to assume that many of the podcast SaaS applications started 
		off as monoliths too. This leads us to speculate that due to the growing user base, it could become increasingly harder to manage such applications and a different 
		approach is required.</p>
		<p>Monolithic SaaS applications, such as those used for podcasts, are usually composed of a webserver, a load balancer, a catalogue of podcasts, a payment system (for 
		subscription) and a database (talend, 2022).</p>
		<p>Breaking down a monolith requires experienced architects and developers and can be costly; microservices can also be bad for the business if implemented incorrectly, 
		for example, if microservice boundaries are worked out wrong (Newman, 2019). It can also be complex to operate and troubleshoot (Newman, 2019).</p>
		<p>However, at the same time it can improve the team’s autonomy, reduce the time taken to deploy the new features, provide cost effective scaling, lessen the impact of 
		outages, etc (Newman, 2019).</p>
		<p>The breakdown of the monolith could begin with building the underlaying architecture, continuous delivery pipelines and APIs (Fowler, 2018), for example, it could 
		include building the user authentication service first: the edge service which is loosely coupled. This could be followed by other items, such as the podcast 
		subscriptions, podcast notifications, payments, etc.</p>
		<p>Next, the data in the monolith database should be decomposed to work with the new microservices (Behara, 2018), i.e. it should follow a domain driven design. For example,
		we may want to store the podcast payment information in the database separate from the one which stores the podcast author information.</p>
		<p>The end product could contain of multiple microservices for managing the payments, users, podcast authors, podcast posting, podcast subscription, podcast downloads for 
		offline listening, etc. </p>

		<p>We had a team meeting to discuss how we will do the unit 6 assignment and we have agreed on the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Ali to send the code he has done so far on the sockets and we will see if we can implement it.</li>
				<li>We are all to research and understand as well as we can:
					<ul>
						<li>Python sockets</li>
						<li>Python producer consumer</li>
						<li>Docker</li>
						<li>Kafka and how producer consumer works</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Look for examples of either:
					<ul>
						<li>straight forward python code which uses two containers, producer consumer, sockets and a secure protocol.</li>
						<li>kafka implementation which uses two containers and a secure protocol.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>We will research protocols which we could implement in Python with examples preferably that fit in our design.</li>
				<li>On Tuesday we will decide whether we are going to be using Kafka or straight forward python and no kafa.</li>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>In this unit we have been asked to complete a Wiki activity on suitable network protocols for the smart home systems and to produce an initial post for the discussion 
		forum discussing how the monolithic architecture of a chosen domain could be broken down.</p>
		<p>I found it a little harder preparing for the forum post as I could not find many practical suggestions on the microservices implementation. The is also a lack of practical 
		examples on how different companies achieved the microservice architecture. Many guidelines are very generic rather than giving some useful tips. However, the Fowler (2019) guidelines 
		were by far the best ones.</p>
		<p>For the Wiki activity, we had to imagine a smart home system made up of three devices, the controller hub and an application that allows to manage it away from home and discuss 
		suitable network protocols and their security issues/benefits. Once again, I found it a little confusing. Network protocols come at various levels and I was not sure if we 
		should consider protocols for each level, or pick a suitable protocol stack and discuss it. I ended up discussing 6LoWPAN protocol and how it could be integrated with other 
		network and application level protocols for added security. That said, I am still struggling to fully understand how all these different layer protocols work together and 
		I feel like the lecturecast material should have included some of this information to ensure we know our basics.</p>
		<p>This week's reading included a couple of papers (White et al, 2017; Campbell et al, 1994) on the Quality of Service (QoS), a paper on the 5G QoS (Daengsi & Wuttidittachotti, 2020),
		another paper on the attack trees, how to prune them and prepare the countermeasures (Kordy, 2013) and some online pages on the producer/consumer design pattern in Python 
		(Shene, 2014; Tech Monger, 2018).</p>
		<p>Articles on the producer/consumer were very useful since we have to use this design patter for our unit 6 assignment. I also enjoyed reading about the 5G QoS in India and 
		I agree that an assessment is needed to ensure that the implemention of the new generation network is actually worth while.</p>
		<p>The papers on the QoS and IoT where also interesting. As the authors highlight, the IoT exploded and there are many devices connected together, however, the rollout of 
		the new devices appears to have focused on the devices and the new inventions rather than the quality of service. Especially for the critical IoT devices such as the security 
		cameras, pet cameras, smart locks, smart doorbells, the service has to be always available, the latency has to be low, there must not be any loss of the data packets, and it 
		appears almost as if the devices are rolled out first and then any QoS issues are addressed afterwards if the customers complain - it should be the other way around!</p>
		<p>On Sunday we also held a team meeting in which every team member participated. We struggled to decide how we will approach the coding part. I initially suggested using Python 
		library Kafka, but no one knew about it, so we could not make a decission there and then. Also, some of us are not as good with the coding activities as others, and so 
		we try to split the tasks in such way that those not comfortable with coding can do readme files, testing documents, etc. But again, we could not quite agree. So we decided to 
		do a lot of research and discuss this again on Tuesday when we will make a decission on the approach we will take.</p>
