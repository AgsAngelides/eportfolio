		<h3>Introduction to the module</h3>
		<p>This module aims to introduce the students to the Principles of the Information Risk Management, its assessment and mitigation techniques. In summary, the purpose of this module 
		is to provide:
		<ul>
			<li>A basic understanding of the Information Risk Management principles.</li>
			<li>An understanding of the relationships between the Information Risk management and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).</li>
			<li>An understanding of the residual risks in the SDLC.</li>
			<li>An introduction into the current and future chalanges, limitations and opportunities.</li>
		</ul>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The aim of the unit 1 is to review the common definitions of the Information Risk Management and other relared terminologies, discuss related Security Management Concepts and the 
	Risk Management Process (the risk assessment, qualifying and mitigation). We have also reviewed various approaches of quantifying and qualifying the risk.</p>

		<p>The first week of the Information Risk Management module was about us getting introduced to our tutor, touching upon the upcoming assignments, starting to learn some basics 
		on the Risk Management in terms of information security and to get to know our new teams.</p>
		<p>The team allocation did not happen until much later in the week, which meant that we lost quite a bit of time in working out the logistics on how we are to communicated, 
		everyone's availability, etc. The teams were also not assigned this time and we had to rather provide our own preference. Which can be good too, but also, it was the reason 
		why the team assignment took so much time. I think it would have been better if we were assigned teams at the beginning of the week rather than having to wait for seminar 
		to find out how the team assignment process will happen and then having to wait a few more days after that.</p>
		<p>The reading in this unit included the first three chapers of the Sutton (2021) book on the Information Risk Management, the Hubbard book (2009) on the failure of risk management 
		and the risk management guide produced by NIST (2002). I found the book by Hubbard to be quite controversial: I do not think I agree with his statements that non quantitative 
		risk assessment methods used by the management teams of various companies is a terrible idea. Insurance, finance companies, etc. have a lot of pre-existing data which they 
		are often very protective of which can be used in calculating the risk likelihood, impact, cost, etc. However, for many smaller or medium sized business this data does not 
		exist. The risk management still needs to performed based on the best assumptions and so the low, medium, high qualifications to provide some value, in my opinion.</p>
		<p>The document published by NIST was also very informative. The risk management guidance provided in the document was very clear and informative and could be easily followed 
		by less experienced professionals who need to implement risk management systems. I think this guidance will also be useful when completing our team assignments.</p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The Unit 2 of the Information Risk Management module aims to review the Risk Management Process (RMP), review the different research methods (Qualitative vs Quantitative) and 
	discuss how the user participation impacts the RMP.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>In the unit 2 we have been asked to submit an initial collaborative discussion forum post and to read upon the risk identification processes. We have started work on the 
		unit 3 team assignment document.</p>
		<p>The collaborative discussion required us to read a paper on the user participation impact on the Information Systems Security Risk Management (Spears & Barki, 2010) and to 
		answer some questions, such as providing details of the Quantative vs Qualitative research methods used by the authors, their discoveries on how the users have a positive impact 
		on the Risk Managament processes, etc. Also, how do we think not having any users to work with will impact our risk assessments we will have to complete. 
		<br>
		I found the article being interesting, however, I do not quite agree with the authors implying that the user usefullness in the Information Security Risk Management policies cancels 
		out the statement that users are also the weakest link in the information security process. Whilst I agree that the users provide very useful information required to design 
		good quality Information Security Risk Management policies and that the user involvement may increase their awaraness and willingness to follow these policies, the users will 
		still remain the weakest link, in my opinion.
		<br>
		Human errors are common in every industry. Stress at work, lack of rest, etc. can make us take the wrong actions, make the wrong decisions which in turn can cause security breaches 
		unintentionally. Whilst the user buy in helps and it does reduce the risk of human related vulnerabilities, it does not remove it.</p>
		<p>We also had to read a chaper in the book by Sutton (2021) on the Risk Identification process. The author provided some very helpful tips on how to assess the identified 
		risk impact, who should be involved in these assessments as well as some helpful tips on how the semi-quantitative impact assessment methods could be used. 
		<br>The auhor has also highlighted that when assessing the impact, employee wellbeing impact should also be considered which, I have to say, I did not think about it. 
		Employee wellbeing is a very important aspect of the risk assessment, in my opinion, and based on me not having thought about it before, it made me wonder how many more 
		professionals in the IT industry would only assess the impact considering only the technical, operational and user related risk aspects.</p>
