	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The aim of the unit 1 is to review the common definitions of the Information Risk Management and other relared terminologies, discuss related Security Management Concepts and the 
	Risk Management Process (the risk assessment, qualifying and mitigation). We have also reviewed various approaches of quantifying and qualifying the risk.</p>

		<p>The first week of the Information Risk Management module was about us getting introduced to our tutor, touching upon the upcoming assignments, starting to learn some basics 
		on the Risk Management in terms of information security and to get to know our new teams.</p>
		<p>The team allocation did not happen until much later in the week, which meant that we lost quite a bit of time in working out the logistics on how we are to communicated, 
		everyone's availability, etc. The teams were also not assigned this time and we had to rather provide our own preference. Which can be good too, but also, it was the reason 
		why the team assignment took so much time. I think it would have been better if we were assigned teams at the beginning of the week rather than having to wait for seminar 
		to find out how the team assignment process will happen and then having to wait a few more days after that.</p>
		<p>The reading in this unit included the first three chapers of the Sutton (2021) book on the Information Risk Management, the Hubbard book (2009) on the failure of risk management 
		and the risk management guide produced by NIST (2002). I found the book by Hubbard to be quite controversial: I do not think I agree with his statements that non quantitative 
		risk assessment methods used by the management teams of various companies is a terrible idea. Insurance, finance companies, etc. have a lot of pre-existing data which they 
		are often very protective of which can be used in calculating the risk likelihood, impact, cost, etc. However, for many smaller or medium sized business this data does not 
		exist. The risk management still needs to performed based on the best assumptions and so the low, medium, high qualifications to provide some value, in my opinion.</p>
		<p>The document published by NIST was also very informative. The risk management guidance provided in the document was very clear and informative and could be easily followed 
		by less experienced professionals who need to implement risk management systems. I think this guidance will also be useful when completing our team assignments.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>In the first team meeting of this module, there were three of us who had participated: myself, Sherelle and Kevin.</p>
		<p>The meeting was quick and productive. We discussed the oustanding tasks of the unit 3 assignment, and how we will divide those up. I took upon myself to do the conclusion, 
		Sherelle will prepare a roadmap demonstrating the ERP implementation and Keving will work on a heat map.</p>
		<p>We have all agreed to work on cutting the word count down and completing more research on the topics we didn't have much on.</p>
		</div>
		
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>In the unit 2 we have been asked to submit an initial collaborative discussion forum post and to read upon the risk identification processes. We have started work on the 
		unit 3 team assignment document.</p>
		<p>The collaborative discussion required us to read a paper on the user participation impact on the Information Systems Security Risk Management (Spears & Barki, 2010) and to 
		answer some questions, such as providing details of the Quantative vs Qualitative research methods used by the authors, their discoveries on how the users have a positive impact 
		on the Risk Managament processes, etc. Also, how do we think not having any users to work with will impact our risk assessments we will have to complete. 
		<br>
		I found the article being interesting, however, I do not quite agree with the authors implying that the user usefullness in the Information Security Risk Management policies cancels 
		out the statement that users are also the weakest link in the information security process. Whilst I agree that the users provide very useful information required to design 
		good quality Information Security Risk Management policies and that the user involvement may increase their awaraness and willingness to follow these policies, the users will 
		still remain the weakest link, in my opinion.
		<br>
		Human errors are common in every industry. Stress at work, lack of rest, etc. can make us take the wrong actions, make the wrong decisions which in turn can cause security breaches 
		unintentionally. Whilst the user buy in helps and it does reduce the risk of human related vulnerabilities, it does not remove it.</p>
		<p>We also had to read a chaper in the book by Sutton (2021) on the Risk Identification process. The author provided some very helpful tips on how to assess the identified 
		risk impact, who should be involved in these assessments as well as some helpful tips on how the semi-quantitative impact assessment methods could be used. 
		<br>The auhor has also highlighted that when assessing the impact, employee wellbeing impact should also be considered which, I have to say, I did not think about it. 
		Employee wellbeing is a very important aspect of the risk assessment, in my opinion, and based on me not having thought about it before, it made me wonder how many more 
		professionals in the IT industry would only assess the impact considering only the technical, operational and user related risk aspects.</p>
		<p>This week we have also started working on our Unit 3 assignment and submitted our team contract. It was a little harder getting started this module, since we were not 
		allocated to our teams until the start of the Unit 2, which meant that we waisted a lot of time. However, everyone in our team have worked together before and so getting into 
		the rythm wasn't too complicated. We made a good progress on our assignment which is coming up in the Unit and had a team meeting on Sunday to agree on what is left to complete 
		on the assignment.</p>

		<p>The below is response from my peer Pal (2022) on my original forum discussion post.</p>
		<blockquote><cite>
			<p>You have nicely highlighted the benefits of user involvement in the SRM process. The research paper by Spears and Barki (2010) strongly negated the prevailing 
			assumption that users are the weakest link in the SRM strategy. In the end you have, I feel, rightly emphasised that we will have to rely on the Quantitative data 
			analysis of pre-existing data of risk assessments performed on similar applications and companies to fulfil our assignment.</p>
			<p>But there lies the inherent weakness in this strategy, as you have yourself acknowledged in one of the replies (ref), making assumptions about an organisation 
			does not come without its disadvantages. The assumptions may fall short in predicting future business conditions which could create deviations with a large impact 
			on the organisation (Khorsandi & Aven, 2017). This may reduce the validity of the risk analysis performed.</p>
			<p>I would like to draw your attention to the use of threat modelling concepts which work on the principle of STRIDE (how to find threats) and DREAD (method for 
			determining risks). These approaches do have their limitations but recent work and development of threat modelling software tools, such as ThreatModeler (ThreatModeler, 
			2016), OWASP threat dragon, Irius Risk (Hurlbut, 2017) may prove to be valuable for our task.</p>

		<blockquote><cite>
			<p>Hi Anoushka,
			<br>
			I absolutely agree, and as I mentioned in my original post, there are many disadvantages of using assumptions when producing a risk assessment.</p>
			<p>Your proposed threat modelling and risk assessment methods are widely used and accepted among the professionals, however, these still rely on the assumptions in 
			the absence of access to the users and data. Thus, the results produced by these tools could still fall short in producing anything of use.</p>
			<p>However, as the paper Frage & Askeland (2020) points out, assumptions are unavoidable in the quantitative data analysis, when qualitative data analysis is not an 
			option: assumptions are used in every risk assessment. However, as long as the risk analyst is aware of the assumptions and the potential risks associated to those 
			and address it as part of the risk assessment report, the decision makers will have a better picture and will still be able to make better justified decisions.</p>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Acme Manufacturing has decided to purchase an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system and is considering three options:
			  <ul>
				<li>A commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution.</li>
				<li>An open-source (OS) solution.</li>
				<li>An in-house developed solution.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Company Profile and Risk Appetite</h3>
			<p>Acme Manufacturing is a small-to-medium sized enterprise (SME), employing 150 staff. They currently use spreadsheets to track and manage resource 
			  planning and scheduling. Based upon research into similar organisations, this report makes the following assumptions:
			  <ul>
				<li>The company has a small IT team where every person performs multiple tasks (Malhotra & Temponi, 2010).</li>
				<li>The company has a flat hierarchy, enabling faster decisions (Poba-nzaou & Raymondl, 2010).</li>
				<li>Acme Manufacturing is profitable; annual turnover up to £25m (Clark, 2022).</li>
				<li>The company prioritises steady over aggressive growth (Yap & Ng, 2015).</li>
				<li>The company is privately owned, based on the SME UK statistics (Office for National Statistics, 2018).</li>
				<li>The company uses a functional organizational structure; the tasks are divided into functional units where each unit handles one aspect of the 
				  product/service (Kovaci et al, 2021).</li>
			</ul>
			Based upon this profile, according to the UK SMEs Survey by Studio Graphene (Jones, 2021) Acme Manufacturing is likely risk averse and possesses a low-risk 
			appetite.
			</p>
			<h3>Business risks</h3>
			<p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Lack of employee buy-in can negatively impact ERP implementation time, effort, and cost (Malhotra & Temponi, 2010).</li>
			  <li>Poorly implemented ERP systems may not provide return on investment and impact performance (Quiescenti, 2006; Summer, 2000).</li>
			  <li>SMEs are less likely to survive/overcome a failed ERP implementation (Muscatello et al., 2003).</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>ERP Options Risk Assessment</h3>
			<p>
			<table>
			  <tr>
				<th>ERP options</th>
				<th>Applicable risks</th>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>COTS Solution</td>
				<td>
				  <ul>
					<li>R1 - Due to inflexibility, the COTS solution may not support all business requirements (Malhotra & Temponi, 2010).</li>
					<li>R2 - New versions can incur additional implementation costs (Babey, 2006).</li>
					<li>R3 - COTS tend to require a high level of costly customisation (Babey, 2006; Quiescenti, 2006).</li>
					<li>R4 - Total costs of a COTS solution often reduce annual profits (Holland & Skarke, 2001).</li>
					<li>R5 - Increases reliance on a single vendor and inherits any vendor security issues (Tasnawijitwong & Samanchuen, 2018).</li>
					<li>R6 - 66% to 70% of ERP implementations fail (Poba‐Nzaou et al, 2008) leading to significant financial loss if COTS solution is used.</li>
					<li>R7 - Many known COTS providers do not support the DR requirements (QuickBooks, 2011; OracleNetsuite, 2022).</li>
				  </ul>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>Open-source solution</td>
				<td>
				  <ul>
					<li>R1 - No vendor support available (Olson et al, 2018).</li>
					<li>R2 - Lack of documentation, compliance with industrial standards, liability responsibility (Olson et al, 2018).</li>
					<li>R3 - High level of customisation, if implemented, can introduce security vulnerabilities (Ashraf, 2019).</li>
					<li>R4 - Open-source libraries often introduce security vulnerabilities (Veracode, 2021).</li>
					<li>R5 - Open-source ERP could have higher IT costs (Economides & Katsamakas, 2006, as cited in Johansson & Sudzina, 2008 ).</li>
				  </ul>
				</td>
			  </tr>
			  <tr>
				<td>In-house solution</td>
				<td>
				  <ul>
					<li>R1 - Inexperienced personnel can take a long time to implement an in-house ERP solution (Malhotra & Temponi, 2010).</li>
					<li>R2 - Potential security risks as the developer is inexperienced (Amroussi, 2022).</li>
					<li>R3 - The system may become unmanageable if the developer leaves the organisation (Shahzad et. al., 2017).</li>
				  </ul>
				</td>

			</p>
			<h3>Recommendation and Conclusions</h3>
			<p>Based on the identified requirements and risks, we recommend the open-source solution. </p>
			<p>The benefits of open-source ERP applications exceed the potential disadvantages (see Table 1):
			  <ul>
				<li>Tools are more customisable to support business needs (Johansson & Sudzina, 2008)</li>
				<li>Implementation can be scheduled around the business roadmap (see Appendix A)</li>
				<li>The cost is lower (Riehle, 2007) resulting in a lower failure cost</li>
				<li>The IT team, after training, is likely to provide prompter support (Chang, 2004)</li>
				<li>Disaster recovery objectives may be easier to satisfy (see appendix B), especially if an open-source cloud-based solution is used (CompuData, 2019)</li>

		<p>In the unit 3 we have been asked to read upon the Object Oriented Development (Rumbaugh et at, 2003) and various Agile models (Abrahamsson, 2003). We also had to submit our 
		team project on assessing the risks of the three ERP systems that the assigned manufacturing company is looking to implement whilst also having to continue our discussions 
		started in the Unit 2.</p>
		<p>I have enjoyed both papers from this unit. We have touched upon the object oriented programming practices in the first module of this Master's degree and have even been asked to 
		implement it in our end of module assignment. I still think that whilst the papers provide a good on overview of this method's benefits, I would myself prefer having some practical 
		assignments, such as lessons on Codio, which we could complete to learn the practical ways to implement it.
		<br>
		Meanwhile the paper on Agile was quite informative, since it covered quite a few different Agile practices. I liked how the authors recognised the lack of clear guidance many of these 
		Agile methods provide. I have often observed during my career as an IT prohect manager, that many companies state they use one or the other Agile method, without stopping and thinking 
		whether it is actually the method they are using. Agile, these days bave become a collection of tools rather than a mentality too. I often find companies call themselves agile if 
		they use one of the popular backlog tracking tools, such as Jira, Github, Trello, etc.
		<br>
		My one concer was, however, the age of these papers. I think there is more recent research in both these fields that could have been used as the reading materials for this module.</p>
		<p>This week we have also finalised our report due to be submitted this week as a team. I think the resulting submission was of good quality, however, it was dissapointing 
		that some did not contribute as much as others or started contributing when the document was being finalised, despite of multiple reminders.</p>

		<p>This week we have continued on reading more research papers, whilst focusing on the risks associated to the Software Development Lifecycle. The two papers by 
		Hijazi et al. (2014) and Roy et al. (2015) have provided a very detailed overview of a variety of risks that fall under each software development stage. The papers have 
		also reviewed the overal risk categories that should be used when conducting a risk assessment, to ensure no certain type of risk is underlooked.
		<br>
		The papers do provide a good guidance and could be used when assessing risks associated to any new software development. Ideas discussed by both authors are similar and 
		discuss the need of addressing the risks applicable to each software development stage, rather than an overall risk, as a means of ensurring that the all types of risks 
		are analysed. 
		<br>
		I don't see any downsides to the proposed risk analysis methodology and I can see it working well in the real-world situations, given my own Project Management experiences. 
		However, I do think that these risk analysis methods are less known, even though they have a lot to offer, and that potentially the Information technology community 
		should look at developing the risk analysis framework most suitable to this particular industry.</p>
