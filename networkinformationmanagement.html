		<h3>Introduction to the module</h3>
        <p>The 'Network and Information Security Management' module aims to provide the students with the necessary knowledge and hands on experience within the network technology subject.
		Concepts such as vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, forensic analysis and breach management will be discussed. The opportunity to evaluate ones personal development 
		will also be provided.</p>
		<p>Upon the completion of this module, students are expected to be able to:
			<ul>
				<li>Identify and analyse information security risks and vulnerabilities whilst also determining the methods, tools and techniques for managing/solving it at the same time.</li>
				<li>Design and appraise computer programs for managing and auditing security issues.</li>
				<li>Research and collate data from various security alert and warning sources to systematically analyse security breaches and issues.</li>
				<li>Discuss issues faced by Cyber professionals, such as: legal, social, ethical, professional, etc.</li>
			</ul>

	<div class="content">
	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The Unit 1 focuses on the 4 security tenets (Availability, Confidentialy, Integrity, Non-repudiation) and its applicability to Information Security. It also provides theoretical knowledge 
	on threats, risks and vulnerabilities, their classification, assessments and resolution types. The Information Security career path, potential roles (both technical and business needs related) 
	are also reviewed.</p>
	<p>The learning outcomes include being able to explain basic principles of Information Security Management, describing the mentioned 4 security tenets, describing what constitutes a threat and 
	vulnerability and knowing some existing Information Security professions.</p>
	
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Discussion topic: Week 1 - Threats and Vulnerabilities applicable to medical mannequin, and its mitigation.</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p><b>Learning outcome:</b> to be able to research and synthesise data from various sources on security vulnerabilities and its mitigation.</p>
		<p>The initial post is based on the analysis of the Glisson, W., Andel, T., McDonald, T., Jacobs, M., Campbell, M. & Mayr, J. (2015) Compromising a Medical Mannequin. Healthcare Information Systems 
		and Technology (Sighealth) paper. It attempts to identify threats and vulnerabilities discussed in the said paper, and to propose some mitigation options.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Team contract and first team meeting</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>We had our first team meeting on the 13th of March in which all but one team member participated. The purpose of the team meeting was to discuss how we are going to works as a team and to agree 
		on the team contract which can be seen below. It highlights every team member's expecations, goals and agreed processes on how the team work will be carried out.
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./network and information security management/unit 1/team contract.png"></p>
		<p>Since it was agreed to send the main communications via email to everyone, the meeting was followed by an email from myself (teal lead) shortly after to confirm what we agreed upon (such as meeting at 2pm GMT 
		on Sundays on Zoom if there are upcoming team submissions. The purpose of the email was also to communicat to all team members the upcoming team assignments we must start working on.</p>
		</div>
		
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>During the unit 1 we have been asked to start a discussion on the threats and vulnerabilities applicable to a medical mannequin and suggest some ways to mitigate it. Since the unit learning 
		outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats/risks and vulnerabilities, I believe this task has certainly helped me applying the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecturecast into practice. I also enjoyed 
		researching the ways to mitigate the risks discusses in the paper on the Medical Mannequin vulnerabilities and I think the task has allowed me to improve my research and information synthesis skills 
		also listed as one of the learning outcomes.</p>
		<p>The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on team work, which I personally found quite difficult to start with. I remember that in my undergraduate studies, the team work 
		was challenging enough and we were able to work in person. In this module, we have team members from all around the world, so not only we have to work as a team, but we have some other things to consider such as: work 
		engagements, time zones, family requirements, etc. And on top of all that, we also have to produce quality work as a team. I do believe it will be more challenging than team work whilst doing 
		full time studies at a university, however, it has a potential of being more rewarding; we won't only learn the team work skills, but also time management, planning, online meeting etiquette, etc.</p>
		<p>One additional task we were given, included the completion of the Team Contract. The hardest part was getting everyone to agree on the communication channels that work for everyone. However, once 
		that was out of the way and we had the majority of the team members onboard, most of the team worked well together and were able to complete the contract efficiently. As part of the contract negotiations I was 
		assigned as the team leader/facilitator.</p>

	<p>The unit 2 aims to continue on from the unit 1; it further analysis the paper on medical mannequin with the following goals:
		<ul>
			<li>Review vulnerabilities of common electronic devices</li>
			<li>Explain how the exploitation software can be used to abuse those vulnerabilities</li>
			<li>Use industry known methods for threat and vulnerability analysis</li>

		<div class="content">
		<p>The preparation for the seminar 1 has asked us to revisit the vulnerabilities from the paper on the medical mannequin iStan and evaluate them using the DREAD risk analysis methodology 
		we have learned in the lecturecast. The result of the research includes a very short Powerpoint presentation prepared by the group together (our Group 1 research and analysis results can be 
		seen below.

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>During the unit 2 we had to continue our discussions on the topic of the vulnerabilities applicable to the medical mannequin as reviewed by Glisson et al. (2015) and to prepare for the 
		seminar 1. I had enjoyed the discussions and writing the peer responses because it had incouraged me to go and research more on the points mentioned by my peers so I was able to make my case. It 
		has also further developed my skills in being able to collect information and collate it, which is one of the learning goals.
		<br>
		The preparation for the Seminar 1 was also interesting, since I was able to apply the knowledge gained in the lecturecat on the DREAD risk analysis method to an actual life scenario. I think 
		DREAD is a good risk analysis tool to introduce the students to as it is not complicated and it quickly demonstrates the risk analysis objectives without overcomplicating it. The trickiest part of 
		this assignment was the team work. Since it's a non-assessed work, there is less motivation in the team to do the research and even less motivation to do it on time for the seminar. However, 
		we have agreed that the team members who cannot participate in the seminar will do the majority of the data collating work, whilst those able to attend the seminar would present.
		<br>
		We have also had some discussions within the team where we could not quite agree on the DREAD score for the exploitability category for one of the vulnerabilities related to 802.11 wireless transmissoions. 
		Some of the team felt that the exploitability should be ranked at 3, since Microsoft documentation defines 3 (Meier, 2003) as something that an unexperienced hacker could do. Whilst the other team members felt that 
		the Exploitability should be ranked at 1 - only a very experienced hacker could carry out the attack. Eventually, we ended up with a 2 - a 'meet in the middle' approach, however, we had some helpful discussions 
		on the subject before making the decision.
