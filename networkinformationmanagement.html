	<div class="content">
	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The Unit 1 focuses on the 4 security tenets (Availability, Confidentiality, Integrity, Non-repudiation) and its applicability to Information Security. It also provides theoretical knowledge 
	on threats, risks and vulnerabilities, their classification, assessments and resolution types. The Information Security career path, potential roles (both technical and business needs related) 
	are also reviewed.</p>
	<p>The learning outcomes include being able to explain basic principles of Information Security Management, describing the mentioned 4 security tenets, describing what constitutes a threat and 
	vulnerability and knowing some existing Information Security professions.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p><b>Learning outcome:</b> to be able to research and synthesise data from various sources on security vulnerabilities and its mitigation.</p>
		<p>The initial post is based on the analysis of the Glisson, W., Andel, T., McDonald, T., Jacobs, M., Campbell, M. & Mayr, J. (2015) Compromising a Medical Mannequin. Healthcare Information Systems 
		and Technology (Sighealth) paper. It attempts to identify threats and vulnerabilities discussed in the said paper, and to propose some mitigation options.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Team contract and first team meeting</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>We had our first team meeting on the 13th of March in which all but one team member participated. The purpose of the team meeting was to discuss how we are going to works as a team and to agree 
		on the team contract which can be seen below. It highlights every team member's expectations, goals and agreed processes on how the team work will be carried out.
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./network and information security management/unit 1/team contract.png"></p>
		<p>Since it was agreed to send the main communications via email to everyone, the meeting was followed by an email from myself (teal lead) shortly after to confirm what we agreed upon (such as meeting at 2pm GMT 
		on Sundays on Zoom if there are upcoming team submissions. The purpose of the email was also to communicate to all team members the upcoming team assignments we must start working on.</p>
		</div>
		
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>During the unit 1 we have been asked to start a discussion on the threats and vulnerabilities applicable to a medical mannequin and suggest some ways to mitigate it. Since the unit learning 
		outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats/risks and vulnerabilities, I believe this task has certainly helped me applying the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecturecast into practice. I also enjoyed 
		researching the ways to mitigate the risks discusses in the paper on the Medical Mannequin vulnerabilities and I think the task has allowed me to improve my research and information synthesis skills 
		also listed as one of the learning outcomes.</p>
		<p>The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on team work, which I personally found quite difficult to start with. I remember that in my undergraduate studies, the team work 
		was challenging enough and we were able to work in person. In this module, we have team members from all around the world, so not only we have to work as a team, but we have some other things to consider such as: work 
		engagements, time zones, family requirements, etc. And on top of all that, we also have to produce quality work as a team. I do believe it will be more challenging than team work whilst doing 
		full time studies at a university, however, it has a potential of being more rewarding; we won't only learn the team work skills, but also time management, planning, online meeting etiquette, etc.</p>
		<p>One additional task we were given, included the completion of the Team Contract. The hardest part was getting everyone to agree on the communication channels that work for everyone. However, once 
		that was out of the way and we had the majority of the team members onboard, most of the team worked well together and were able to complete the contract efficiently. As part of the contract negotiations I was 
		assigned as the team leader/facilitator.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>During the unit 2 we had to continue our discussions on the topic of the vulnerabilities applicable to the medical mannequin as reviewed by Glisson et al. (2015) and to prepare for the 
		seminar 1. I had enjoyed the discussions and writing the peer responses because it had encouraged me to go and research more on the points mentioned by my peers so I was able to make my case. It 
		has also further developed my skills in being able to collect information and collate it, which is one of the learning goals.
		<br>
		The preparation for the Seminar 1 was also interesting, since I was able to apply the knowledge gained in the lecturecat on the DREAD risk analysis method to an actual real life scenario. I think 
		DREAD is a good risk analysis tool to introduce the students to as it is not complicated and it quickly demonstrates the risk analysis objectives without overcomplicating it. The trickiest part of 
		this assignment was the team work. Since it's a non-assessed work, there is less motivation in the team to do the research and even less motivation to do it on time for the seminar. However, 
		we have agreed that the team members who cannot participate in the seminar will do the majority of the data collating work, whilst those able to attend the seminar would present.
		<br>
		We have also had some discussions within the team where we could not quite agree on the DREAD score for the exploitability category for the 802.11 wireless transmissions related vulnerability. 
		Some of the team felt that the exploitability should be ranked at 3, since Microsoft documentation defines 3 (Meier, 2003) as something that an unexperienced hacker could do. Whilst the other team members felt that 
		the Exploitability should be ranked at 2 - since they felt the exploitability should consider factors such as the perpetrator must be at a close proximity to the router making it harder to exploit the said 
		vulnerability. Eventually, we ended up with a 2/3 - a 'meet in the middle' score and decided to explain our discussion on the seminar instead of trying to reach one score.

		<p>The Unit 3 consisted of a few main tasks. We had to complete individual quick scans of the website assigned to our group and then discuss results with our team; we had to submit our final
		post on vulnerabilities applicable to medical mannequin's and prepare for the seminar we are to have next week in Unit 4 on the subject or TCP/IP and ISO/OSI 7 layer internet protocols.</p>
		<p>I had a clear idea of what I wanted to write about in my final discussion forum post, since I have received valuable peer contributions that pointed out some things I have initially 
		misunderstood in the paper on Medical Mannequin (Glisson, 2015). Other peer initial posts and responses on their posts have also helped me to understand other vulnerability mitigation 
		options that there are. Overall, I think the 3 week long discussion has improved my ability of being able to source relevant information security information from various sources.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, I found the individual scans we had to complete on the website assigned to us more challenging. I have no hands on experience with the command prompt and it was difficult 
		at times locating the right commands to use for Windows machines as it appears there are a lot more resources available for Linux OS machines. Whilst it has been challenging at times, it was 
		also interesting at the same time. Many different reading materials on networks we are assigned discuss hops, latency, etc., so it was helpful being able to finally see how it all works and the 
		ways this information can be obtained. It certainly helped me to better visualise the route a pack tacks across the network from the sender to the recipient.</p>
		<p>Lastly, I have enjoyed the preparation for the next seminar we are to have in Unit 4. The article we had to read has showcased the other side of the information technology: the politics. 
		It has also demonstrated how the very early applications of what we now call Agile method helped TCP/IP network protocol to become the leading one over perhaps more well though through and secure but slow to 
		keep up with the ever changing world ISO/OSI protocol.</p>
		<p>Overall, I feel that the unit learning goals of being able to explain the basic network concepts and being able to perform basic network troubleshooting were achieved throughout the tasks
		we were given this week.</p>

	<p>The unit 4 focuses on learning how to trouble shoot network issues, discuss the outputs produced by the network troubleshooting tools and 
		being able to discuss the differences between the TCP/IP and ISO/OSI network protocols.</p>
		
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit 4 - Initial post</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>The aim of the initial discussion post in the Unit 4 is for us to discuss the scan results of the basic scans we have conducted on our 
			assigned websites. After comparing our scan notes during the team meeting, we have decided to publish the initial post as a team, the 
			summary of which can be seen below.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>In the Unit 4 we have continued our work on the website we were assigned as a group. We have been asked to discuss our individual scan results 
			and summarise these in either an individual initial discussion forum post or a team initial forum post. Whilst the discussions went well, 
			it proved more difficult preparing a team post. We continued using Google documents. I have volunteered putting together a skeleton post 
			using everyone's scan details discussed in the previous week. The skeleton post was then meant to be accessed and edited by every team 
			member prior to submission deadline. The latter proved more difficult, since many of the team members made no contributions towards this 
			post by the deadline we have agreed on the previous week.</p>
		<p>The team work seems to be the most challenging part of this module and definitely the one taking up most time. In addition to the work we have to produce 
			as a team and the research on the topics we are given, I also have to coordinate the team work, assign deadlines, make sure the work gets completed 
			and submitted by the agreed date, schedule team meetings whilst keeping everyone's outside of course arrangements in mind. I enjoy challenges, however, 
			the online team coordination is a lot more difficult than in person. It is also very different from working with other peers in a full time education versus
			an online one.</p>
		<p>Perhaps the difficulties I am experiencing are more due to my own personally and differences in the working style between me and my peers. For example, I 
			have to complete all my tasks with plenty of time before the deadline. I have found it reduces my stress levels and allows me to better structure 
			my work, knowing, I will have time to still make the last minute adjustments if I need to. However, when it comes to an online team work, completing work 
			in advance is not always a possibility. Your team members may have a busy week at work or home life, and they are unlikely to have time to work on the task 
			given in advance. This part of team work is the most difficult one for me, since I feel I cannot control it as well and that in turn makes me more stressed. 
			However, I am learning how to re-adjust my expectations on the work and deadlines and trying to keep flexible. This experience will be absolutely helpful 
			in my current role as Project Manager; in projects with many moving parts things are often out of hands of the project manager, so the expectation management 
			and flexibility should help me with my every day work.</p>
