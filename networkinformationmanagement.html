	<div class="content">
	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The Unit 1 focuses on the 4 security tenets (Availability, Confidentiality, Integrity, Non-repudiation) and its applicability to Information Security. It also provides theoretical knowledge 
	on threats, risks and vulnerabilities, their classification, assessments and resolution types. The Information Security career path, potential roles (both technical and business needs related) 
	are also reviewed.</p>
	<p>The learning outcomes include being able to explain basic principles of Information Security Management, describing the mentioned 4 security tenets, describing what constitutes a threat and 
	vulnerability and knowing some existing Information Security professions.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p><b>Learning outcome:</b> to be able to research and synthesise data from various sources on security vulnerabilities and its mitigation.</p>
		<p>The initial post is based on the analysis of the Glisson, W., Andel, T., McDonald, T., Jacobs, M., Campbell, M. & Mayr, J. (2015) Compromising a Medical Mannequin. Healthcare Information Systems 
		and Technology (Sighealth) paper. It attempts to identify threats and vulnerabilities discussed in the said paper, and to propose some mitigation options.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Team contract and first team meeting</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>We had our first team meeting on the 13th of March in which all but one team member participated. The purpose of the team meeting was to discuss how we are going to works as a team and to agree 
		on the team contract which can be seen below. It highlights every team member's expectations, goals and agreed processes on how the team work will be carried out.
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./network and information security management/unit 1/team contract.png"></p>
		<p>Since it was agreed to send the main communications via email to everyone, the meeting was followed by an email from myself (teal lead) shortly after to confirm what we agreed upon (such as meeting at 2pm GMT 
		on Sundays on Zoom if there are upcoming team submissions. The purpose of the email was also to communicate to all team members the upcoming team assignments we must start working on.</p>
		</div>
		
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>During the unit 1 we have been asked to start a discussion on the threats and vulnerabilities applicable to a medical mannequin and suggest some ways to mitigate it. Since the unit learning 
		outcomes expect us to learn more about the threats/risks and vulnerabilities, I believe this task has certainly helped me applying the knowledge from the Unit 1 lecturecast into practice. I also enjoyed 
		researching the ways to mitigate the risks discusses in the paper on the Medical Mannequin vulnerabilities and I think the task has allowed me to improve my research and information synthesis skills 
		also listed as one of the learning outcomes.</p>
		<p>The 'Network and information security management' module is also heavily focused on team work, which I personally found quite difficult to start with. I remember that in my undergraduate studies, the team work 
		was challenging enough and we were able to work in person. In this module, we have team members from all around the world, so not only we have to work as a team, but we have some other things to consider such as: work 
		engagements, time zones, family requirements, etc. And on top of all that, we also have to produce quality work as a team. I do believe it will be more challenging than team work whilst doing 
		full time studies at a university, however, it has a potential of being more rewarding; we won't only learn the team work skills, but also time management, planning, online meeting etiquette, etc.</p>
		<p>One additional task we were given, included the completion of the Team Contract. The hardest part was getting everyone to agree on the communication channels that work for everyone. However, once 
		that was out of the way and we had the majority of the team members onboard, most of the team worked well together and were able to complete the contract efficiently. As part of the contract negotiations I was 
		assigned as the team leader/facilitator.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>During the unit 2 we had to continue our discussions on the topic of the vulnerabilities applicable to the medical mannequin as reviewed by Glisson et al. (2015) and to prepare for the 
		seminar 1. I had enjoyed the discussions and writing the peer responses because it had encouraged me to go and research more on the points mentioned by my peers so I was able to make my case. It 
		has also further developed my skills in being able to collect information and collate it, which is one of the learning goals.
		<br>
		The preparation for the Seminar 1 was also interesting, since I was able to apply the knowledge gained in the lecturecat on the DREAD risk analysis method to an actual real life scenario. I think 
		DREAD is a good risk analysis tool to introduce the students to as it is not complicated and it quickly demonstrates the risk analysis objectives without overcomplicating it. The trickiest part of 
		this assignment was the team work. Since it's a non-assessed work, there is less motivation in the team to do the research and even less motivation to do it on time for the seminar. However, 
		we have agreed that the team members who cannot participate in the seminar will do the majority of the data collating work, whilst those able to attend the seminar would present.
		<br>
		We have also had some discussions within the team where we could not quite agree on the DREAD score for the exploitability category for the 802.11 wireless transmissions related vulnerability. 
		Some of the team felt that the exploitability should be ranked at 3, since Microsoft documentation defines 3 (Meier, 2003) as something that an unexperienced hacker could do. Whilst the other team members felt that 
		the Exploitability should be ranked at 2 - since they felt the exploitability should consider factors such as the perpetrator must be at a close proximity to the router making it harder to exploit the said 
		vulnerability. Eventually, we ended up with a 2/3 - a 'meet in the middle' score and decided to explain our discussion on the seminar instead of trying to reach one score.

		<p>The Unit 3 consisted of a few main tasks. We had to complete individual quick scans of the website assigned to our group and then discuss results with our team; we had to submit our final
		post on vulnerabilities applicable to medical mannequin's and prepare for the seminar we are to have next week in Unit 4 on the subject or TCP/IP and ISO/OSI 7 layer internet protocols.</p>
		<p>I had a clear idea of what I wanted to write about in my final discussion forum post, since I have received valuable peer contributions that pointed out some things I have initially 
		misunderstood in the paper on Medical Mannequin (Glisson, 2015). Other peer initial posts and responses on their posts have also helped me to understand other vulnerability mitigation 
		options that there are. Overall, I think the 3 week long discussion has improved my ability of being able to source relevant information security information from various sources.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, I found the individual scans we had to complete on the website assigned to us more challenging. I have no hands on experience with the command prompt and it was difficult 
		at times locating the right commands to use for Windows machines as it appears there are a lot more resources available for Linux OS machines. Whilst it has been challenging at times, it was 
		also interesting at the same time. Many different reading materials on networks we are assigned discuss hops, latency, etc., so it was helpful being able to finally see how it all works and the 
		ways this information can be obtained. It certainly helped me to better visualise the route a pack tacks across the network from the sender to the recipient.</p>
		<p>Lastly, I have enjoyed the preparation for the next seminar we are to have in Unit 4. The article we had to read has showcased the other side of the information technology: the politics. 
		It has also demonstrated how the very early applications of what we now call Agile method helped TCP/IP network protocol to become the leading one over perhaps more well though through and secure but slow to 
		keep up with the ever changing world ISO/OSI protocol.</p>
		<p>Overall, I feel that the unit learning goals of being able to explain the basic network concepts and being able to perform basic network troubleshooting were achieved throughout the tasks
		we were given this week.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit 4 - Initial post</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>The aim of the initial discussion post in the Unit 4 is for us to discuss the scan results of the basic scans we have conducted on our 
			assigned websites. After comparing our scan notes during the team meeting, we have decided to publish the initial post as a team, the 
			summary of which can be seen below.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>In the Unit 4 we have continued our work on the website we were assigned as a group. We have been asked to discuss our individual scan results 
			and summarise these in either an individual initial discussion forum post or a team initial forum post. Whilst the discussions went well, 
			it proved more difficult preparing a team post. We continued using Google documents. I have volunteered putting together a skeleton post 
			using everyone's scan details discussed in the previous week. The skeleton post was then meant to be accessed and edited by every team 
			member prior to submission deadline. The latter proved more difficult, since many of the team members made no contributions towards this 
			post by the deadline we have agreed on the previous week.</p>
		<p>The team work seems to be the most challenging part of this module and definitely the one taking up most time. In addition to the work we have to produce 
			as a team and the research on the topics we are given, I also have to coordinate the team work, assign deadlines, make sure the work gets completed 
			and submitted by the agreed date, schedule team meetings whilst keeping everyone's outside of course arrangements in mind. I enjoy challenges, however, 
			the online team coordination is a lot more difficult than in person. It is also very different from working with other peers in a full time education versus
			an online one.</p>
		<p>Perhaps the difficulties I am experiencing are more due to my own personally and differences in the working style between me and my peers. For example, I 
			have to complete all my tasks with plenty of time before the deadline. I have found it reduces my stress levels and allows me to better structure 
			my work, knowing, I will have time to still make the last minute adjustments if I need to. However, when it comes to an online team work, completing work 
			in advance is not always a possibility. Your team members may have a busy week at work or home life, and they are unlikely to have time to work on the task 
			given in advance. This part of team work is the most difficult one for me, since I feel I cannot control it as well and that in turn makes me more stressed. 
			However, I am learning how to re-adjust my expectations on the work and deadlines and trying to keep flexible. This experience will be absolutely helpful 
			in my current role as Project Manager; in projects with many moving parts things are often out of hands of the project manager, so the expectation management 
			and flexibility should help me with my every day work.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Seminar 3 preparation</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>For the seminar 3 preparation, we have been asked to read a blog post “Geer, D. (2015) 8 Penetration Testing Tools That Will Do the Job. (Network World). All pen security tools in the post 
		were then rated by myself from 1 to 5 (5 being the highest/most popular) in the following categories: Ease of install, Ease of use, Flexibility, Licensing and Reputation.</p>
		<p>I have used 1 for Reputation when the tool was new and not known, and 5 for well-established tools.</p>
		<p>When it came to licensing, I rated open-source free tools at 5, and paid ones based on their price, 1 being the most expensive one.</p>
		<p>When it came to flexibility, I rated it based on the OS each tool supports and the amount of configuration it allows the user to do.</p>
		<p>Ease of use was rated based on how much automation each tool provided and if it required other additional knowledge to run it, e.g. know Linux command line, etc.</p>
		<p>I have also removed the Privacy rating from my scores, as I felt it was unnecessary and confusing.</p>	
		<p>The highest rated tools in my assessment were Metasploit and OWASP ZAP. It seems that it came down to price and the ease of use; i.e. the paid tools lost a lot of points in my assessment. 
		The Linux only based tools were the lowest rated ones in my case, because they were limited to being used on one OS only, despite being free and having a good reputation. Also, Linux only 
		tools require Linux knowledge, which is also another downside, in my opinion.</p>

		<p>We then discussed our scores with the team and decided to add the Privacy category back into the table. We scored privacy based on whether the tool shares your scan data with anyone 
		and whether it is an open source tool. Those that were sending your scan results off to somewhere or someone and those with open source code that could be exploited were scored down in the 
		Privacy category.</p>
		<p>When comparing our scores with the team, my scores were often higher than the scores we ended up giving the tool as a team after having discussed each tool features. The OWASP ZAP was the 
		tool with the highest score in my own evaluations and it still remained the tool with the highest score in the team's assessment. However, other tools that received lower scores from myself

		<div class="content">
		<p>The purpose of the team meeting we had on the 10th of April 2022 was to discuss the progress made on the Unit 6 design document preparation, have a look at the peer review form and talk about 
		the upcoming seminar and its preparation.</p>
		<p>Before the meeting, I have worked on the skeleton of the design document which I have presented on the call. We have agreed to proceed with the proposed structure with a few changes, such as: 
		listing the business priority for each vulnerability in the summary table, using STRIDE methodology for obtaining the list of vulnerabilities, expanding on PCI regulations.</p>
		<p>It was agreed that Kevin would research more on the PCI, whilst I would expand on STRIDE. Every team member was assigned a task of providing three vulnerabilities in the document and recommendations 
		for each in such way that all STRIDE categories and regulatory bodies identified are covered.</p>
		<p>We have also confirmed we are to have two more team meetings during the Unit 6: a meeting on Tuesday (the 12th of April) to review our pen test scores and assumptions to prepare for the upcoming 
		seminar and a meeting on Sunday (the 17th of April) to complete our design document and write the conclusions as the team.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>The unit 5 felt a lot busier than the previous units. There was a lot more work to do in terms of preparation for the Unit 6. I also had issues with the assigned website, since, after conducting 
		some vulnerability scans, my home wifi IP address got blocked by the host of the website. It appears to be a permanent block and going forward I will have to be using VPN to access the page.</p>
		<p>I have enjoyed learning about the pen testing tools available whilst preparing for the seminar taking place in Unit 6. It certainly helps when looking for Cyber security related roles, i.e. 
		I may not have hands on experience on these scanners, but at least now I know what the job specification is asking for in terms of the knowledge and it makes new job screening easier.</p>
		<p>The week has been productive, however, and we had done a lot of work together as a team. When it was the time to have a team meeting, majority of the design document was already in place, and 
		the call went smoother and lasted shorter than I think we have all expectec. Perhaps, this is because we have all finally adjusted to the new team work dynamics.</p>
		<p>I am also still planning the team tasks and sending out the reminders to everyone. This does add extra work, however, I find it enjoyable, especially when we all complete a task with plenty of time.</p>

	<h5><b>Unit overview</b></h5>
	<p>The unit 6 focuses on the selection of the scanning toolset to use on a webapplication. The reading materials for this unit are also meant to assist us with making well though through 
	decisions on this subject. In this unit we are also to submit our first graded assignment as a team as well as the peer reviews. The assignment requires us to create a design document on the 
	website assigned to our team (Group 1) which reviews governing bodies applicable to the website, vulnerabilities related to these governing bodies and proposes the mitigation options ranked 
	using the business priorities.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>We scheduled a mid week meeting to go over the scores we gave to each pen test tool discussed in the Geer, D. (2018) blog post based on the following criteria: ease of install, ease of use,
		flexibility, licensing, privacy and reputation.</p>
		<p>Most of us struggled to grasp the meaning of the 'Privacy' criteria. We were not sure what was meant by it, but eventually, we ended up scoring each tool based on whether it is an open source tool 
		(less privacy) or paid tool (more privacy in most cases). Also based on whether the scan data is shared or storedd locally.</p>
		<p>During the meeting we agreed on team scores for each pen testing tool and scoring category combination, worked out the totals and averages.</p>
		<p>In the end, our team member Hamad hhhas kindly volunteered to surmise all details in the .ppt document ready for the upcoming seminar.</p>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>Loaded With Stuff! (loadedwithstuff.co.uk) is an e-commerce site offering two payment options: outright purchases and ‘Easy Financing’ program. It targets customers looking for the newest technology 
			from known brands. In this report, the authors will describe the system, identify the security and privacy compliance requirements which apply to it, and provide a prioritised list of potential 
			vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations.</p>
			<h3>System Description</h3>
			<p>Loaded With Stuff! was built with the Softaculous automated deployment system and is based on Loaded Commerce Community Edition v6.6. It is located at the A2 Web Hosting data centre in Amsterdam on 
			a shared hosting server with IP address 68.66.247.187. The loadedwithstuff.co.uk domain name is registered through eNom LLC.</p>
			<p>The website collects and stores data, some of which is considered personal, to be able to process the orders, such as: email address, delivery and billing addresses, phone numbers.</p>
			<p>The website does not handle or store any cardholder data (CHD) and the payment page has instead been outsourced to a third party.</p>
			<p>The ‘Easy financing’ finance program appears to be outsourced to an external provider and, thus, it is out of scope of this design document.</p>
			<h3>Governing Regulations</h3>
			<p>The Loaded with Stuff! website belongs to a UK domain; however, the web server is being hosted in the Netherlands (Group 1, 2022). Thus, the governing bodies and the regulations from both the 
			UK and Netherlands were shortlisted as those applicable to the Loaded With Stuff! website:
				<ul>
					<li>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), enforced by the Netherland’s Dutch Data protection authority (van Dam & Janssen, 2021).</li>
					<li>The Data Privacy Act (DPA), enforced by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) (ico., 2022a).</li>
					<li>Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standard (DSS). It is developed by the global PCI Security Standards Council, and enforced through contracts (PCI, 2014).</li>
					<li>Privacy and Electronic Communications (PECR) enforced by the ICO in the UK (ico., 2022b).</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h3>Security Vulnerabilities & Mitigations</h3>
			<p>The theoretical security vulnerabilities relevant to the above list of identified regulations have been prepared using STRIDE methodology and can be viewed below, where each vulnerability 
			has been assigned to a STRIDE (Microsoft, 2022) category (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) and ordered by business priority. 
			The recommendations have also been prepared for each identified security weakness.</p>
			<p>The hosting provider for the site, A2, provides a number of common security mitigations to all customers, including DDoS protection, firewalls, brute force defense, and virus scanning (A2 Web 
			Hosting, 2022). These mitigations are not included in the table below as they are assumed to already be implemented.</p>
			<p>Business priority has been determined based on each vulnerability’s DREAD risk ranking (University of Essex Online, 2022):
				<ul>
					<li>DREAD 0 (no risk), 1 (low risk) - low business priority.</li>
					<li>DREAD 2 (medium risk) - medium business priority.</li>
					<li>DREAD 3 (high risk) - high business priority.</li>
				</ul>

		<p>The unit 6 was a very busy unit when team work and assignments are considered.</p>
		<p>We had to publish out summary post on the basic scans we had to perform in Unit 3, submit the Design document and peer reviews.</p>
		<p>I have managed the team work in such way, that we had started preparing for our Unit 6 assignment 3 weeks in advance. Everyone was given clear tasks and deadlines, and I think it really helped us 
		with not having to rush with the assignment in the end. By the time we had our team meeting to finalise the assignment document, the work was mostly completed, and we only needed to apply the final 
		touches.</p>
		<p>Team work has once again been the most challenging part of this unit and the module overal. Some team members contribute less to the work which makes it harder for the rest, having to pick up extra 
		tasks, since the work needs to be completed in the end. I have tried additional reminder emails on deadlines, we have included everyone on every team communication, however, this has not improved the 
		overall contribution of some. I do, however, think we have definitely started working better as a team as we got to know each other, and the work just happens more naturally. People just pick up 
		tasks voluntarily and crack on with it.</p>
		<p>We have also had to submit our summary post in the discussion forum this week. I found this part hard: less peers contributed in the discussion forum than compared to previous discussions, which meant 
		that were wasn't many people challenging or commenting on your findings. However, our Group 1 Initial post has attracted a lot of attention and made our other peers to question their scan results, which 
		I think is the whole point of these forums. Some of us, with less practical knowledge, can really learn from our peer findings and it is a more informal way of receiving feedback on your work instead 
		of having your tutor to evaluate each work piece.</p>
		<p>Overall, I do feel like my knowledge is growing on the vulnerability scanners. I am gaining practical experience on reviewing the network and being able to obtain relevant information necessary to 
		derive the vulnerabilities. I am becoming more confident in applying the theoretical vulnerability assessments, such as STRIDE, on given case studies, such as our assigned website. I now also have a deeper 
		understanding on TCIP/IP protocals. My research skills have also improved and with all the knowledge I have gained so far, it has become easier to read the materials on the Cyber security subject since 
		I am able to understand better what the authors are trying to say.</p>

		<p>The e-portfolio activity was a staright forward task. We were asked to read various papers discussing the benefits and disadvantages of Kali Linux, then to answer questions such as 'What have you learned?'

		when I had to score Kali Linux. I think I would make a better informed decission this time round.</p>
		<p>The Kali Lianux scanning activity, on the other hand, was a lot more complex. I do not own a Linux machine, so instead had to use a virtual machine. I had trouble with Kali Linux installations. The 
		task was also made a lot more complex by the fact that my home IP address is blocked from accessing our assigned website, so I had to always use a VPN, which would make the scans take longer and would 
		also often not work, requiring constant VPN and machine restarts.
		<br><br>
		I enjoyed the scans themselves and having a chance to learn hands on how the vulnerability detection and information gathering cyber security phases work. However, whilst I haven't struggled with 
		finding the information online to guide me through this process, I sometimes struggled executing it. For example, when using Nikto scanner, the scan would never complete and end because the allowed 
		number of errors would be exceeded. Trying to troubleshoot this took me a lot of time and even after permitting three times more errors, the scans would still not finish. I found these troubleshooting 
		stages very time consuming and frustrating.
		<br><br>
		It is my opinion that it would be beneficial for a university to have seminars which review the work that was assigned and do a 'walk through' as well as an FAQ session with tutors. In my undergraduate 
		studies, we had something called 'labs', where we solved various problems. And then the next session, after the submission, we would have a walk through to help everyone to learn where they went wrong.
		</p>
		<p>In this unit we have also touched on the subjects of Business Continuity and Data Recovery strategies and how closely these two topics are linked to the overall cyber security. This has once again 
		showed me how far the cyber security stretches and how many different areas it impacts. It highlights that a good specialist would not only consider the technical aspects, such as running scanners, pen test 
		tools, patching the systems, but also would be able to conduct risk assessments, contribute towards the business continuity and data recovery policies: Cyber Security specialist must be able to see a 'big picture'.</p>

		<p>The Unit 8 was all about GDPR, case studies and further analysis of these case studies. I have enjoyed reading the real life scenarios of when the companies failed to implement the GDPR 
		regulations correctly and preparing the initial discussion forum post on the case study I have chosen. What I found interesting in these case studies was that often the companies considered 
		they had all the necessary GDPR controls in place, however, when the investigation began, it turned out that their interpretation of the said requirements was not quite correct. I think that 
		this is the main issue for many businesses: the GDPR is quite vague about how the various articles should be implemented. A company may consider they have addressed all the GDPR points, however, 
		should an issue arrise in future, they may find themselves in the situation where the Commissioner has determined they didn't have enough evidence, for example, supporting the data requests.</p>
		<p>I think that companies should consider reviewing the case studies themselves on an annual basis to ensure their policies would stand strong in case they are being investigated. It appears, 
		however, these are more often used in academic bacground, which is a shame, since there are many lessons to be learned in them.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>We had another team meeting on the 8th of May. The main purpose of this team meeting was to discuss the scans we had performed on our assigned website whilst trying to confirm the presence 
		of the theoretical security vulnerabilities identified in the Unit 6 submission and to decide on the next steps.</p>
		<p>Most of the team members have been able to complete their assigned scans by the meeting (including myself) and provide their scan details within the group work document. Some team members 
		had their IP addresses blocked whilst conducting the scans, and had to use other means to access the website to be able to complete their given tasks.</p>
		<p>We have agreed to complete all scans and provide the summary within the main working document in the agreed format by the end of the 10th of May 2022. Then we would all continue on updating 
		the document to meet the assignment criteria and meet up again on the 15th of May to discuss the document format.</p>
		<p>We have also touched upon the subject of presenting our results using charts and agreed to each individually come up with some ideas for the next call, where we can decide which we wish to go 
		with.</p>
		</div>
		
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>The Unit 9 has been very informative on the subject of SIEM tools, various security threats, the topic of digital forensics, various logging tools and the logs in general.</p>
		<p>I found the Unit 9 reading very interesting, as we haven't covered the subject of logs in great detail previously, only touched upon it. In this unit, however, we were introduced on various 
		types of logs within the UNIX and Windows systems, various tools which could be used to read, synthesise and analyse logs. I think logging often takes a back seat in conversations about the 
		security as it's not as 'flashy' and exciting as topics like vunerability scanning, pen testing, etc. However, as demonstrated by various case studies we had to review as part of the preparation 
		for the Unit 10 seminar, logging provides various evidence which often helps with GDPR cases. For example, if the company is logs user accesses to various tools, files, etc., they can use that 
		as a security control to ensure un-auhthorised personnel is not accessing data they are not supposed to.
		<br><br>
		Logging is also extremely important when it comes to an early threat detection. Cyber attacks leave a pattern behind which can often be found within the logs. If the attack is spanning over a 
		longer period of time, logs can help to prevent it. If the cyber attack has already happened, the cyber attack pattern in the logs can help improve existing tools which use logs to indentify attacks 
		to ensure other business can avoid it.</p>
		<p>In this unit we have also touched upon the 'to do list' of a breach, i.e. the action plan of a business which should be followed wehn the data breach is discovered. We then applied this 
		theoretical plan on our chosen data breach which had happened in a real world. My chosen breach was the myFitnessPal data breach which took place in 2018 (Lukic, 2021). When working through post data 
		breach to do list, I have noticed how well Under Armor (the company to which the application belongs) handled this data breach: the customers and the regulatory bodies were notified promptly, 
		the users were made to change their passwords following the breach and sent a guidance to its customers on how to protect their data. External imvestigation companies were also hired to investigate 
		this incident. The approach the Under Armor took was a very grown up one, which I think helped them to reduce the reputational impact.</p>
		<p>Another subject we looked at this week, was the digital forensics, the purpose of it, the techniques and tools applied within this field. I have always considered digital forensics as a very 
		niche area. My understanding has always been that it is mostly used when a crime has been commited, which I think is still the case. However, it could also be used by business to investigate 
		their own employee malpractice, for example. The digital forensics approach of collecting the evidence first, then examining it, analysing it and reporting on the findings could also be applied 
		to any security/data breach in general too.</p>
		<p>In the Unit 9 we have also continued on working on the Unit 11 assignment. This week our goal as a team was to complete the scans to identify the vulnerabilities identified in the OWASP Top 10 
		list as well as the vulnerabilities we have discussed in our team Unit 6 submission. The scans had to be completed on our assigned website. <br><br>I think working as a team on the Unit 6 assignment 
		has helped the team to 'jel' and figure out how we can work together online. Because of this, the work on producting the Unit 11 executive summary has been a lot smoother, with everyone just cracking on 
		with their assigned tasks and updating the assignment document as we go. <br><br>The participation has also improved, and it seems like the whole of the team is no working towards the end result together.</p>

		<p>The Unit 10 was a very busy unit. We had the final discussion forum post to submit, new materials to study and we have continued working on our Unit 11 assignment: the Executive summary</p>
		<p>I have enjoyed learning more about various types of security breaches. It felt a little like the revision of the previous module as we have touched upon this topic previously (the types of 
		breaches). That said, it was helpful to go over it again, because in every day world a lot of these words used to refer to different types of attacks become so interchangeable, whilst they are 
		actually very different and have very different attack mechanisms. The security breach checklist was a new topic which carried on from the previous unit which I found very helpful and something 
		I could definitely see myself implementing in the real world scenario.</p>
		<p>The summary post in the discussion forum was a fairly straightforward task. I haven't had many responses from the peers on my initial post, so I my summary post was more about me reflecting on 
		the thoughts I had since my initial post. I think the subject of the recruitment data security when it comes to organisations who aren't recruitment companies is not often discussed and many 
		have never thought about it until this discussion. A lot of secure data management practices which could be applied to your customer data cannot really be applied to the data of the irregular job 
		applicants. Which I think is what made this topic interesting for me since it highlights how much personal data organisations could be storing which they do not consider as personal data or treat it 
		as such.</p>
		<p>Finally, I have continued working on our Unit 11 assignment and I think a good progress was made. I was a little dissapointed that some of the team members did not stick to the agreed deadlines 
		by which the information should be researched and summarised in our report, which meant that we haven't done as much as I would have liked. That said, we started working on this project early on 
		which meant that these types of delays didn't have a dramatic impact and we are still going to complete the work by the deadline, if not earlier.</p>

		<h3>Executive summary - Group 1</h3>
		<br><br>
		<p><b>Introduction</b>
		<br><br>
		Loaded With Stuff! (loadedwithstuff.co.uk) is an e-commerce site targeting customers looking for the newest technology from known brands. In an earlier design document, 
		the authors identified the regulatory bodies applicable to the website and reviewed a list of relevant theoretical security vulnerabilities.
		<br><br>
		In this executive summary, the authors provide an overview of the confirmed theoretical vulnerabilities as well as newly discovered ones applicable to LoadedWithStuff! 
		website and identifies mitigation recommendations ordered by business priority which address applicable regulations identified in the Design document.</p>
		<p><b>Scanning Methodology</b>
		<br><br>
		The list of vulnerabilities identified in the design document is not considered all encompassing, thus, to ensure all critical web vulnerabilities have been addressed in this executive report, the OWASP Top 10 
		(2021) was employed as a framework for performing vulnerability scans. The OWASP recommendations target the most critical exposures and are well documented and used within the 
		industry (Fredj et al, 2021).
		<br><br>
		By using the OWASP Top 10, a standard security baseline is developed. It ensures the presence of critical security configurations and minimises risk by providing 
		required technical and administrative controls that are implemented as required due diligence, in a proactive approach (Jenkins,2022). The OWASP top 10 provides 
		any business with value through following the processes illustrated in our methodology in Figure 1 (RedScan Teams, 2020).
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./network and information security management/unit 11/Figure 1.png">
		</p>
		<p><b>Scanning Tools</b>
		<br><br>
		The details of vulnerability scanners used to confirm the presence of the exposures discussed in the previous design document and to discover any new ones are summarised in Table 1.

			</tr>
		</table>
		</p>
		<p><b>Limitations of Scanning Activities</b>
		<br><br>
		The hosting provider for the target website, A2 Web Hosting, has implemented a number of security controls for their clients (A2hosting.com, 2022):
			<ul>
				<li>Distributed Denial of Service Protection</li>
				<li>Dual Web Hosting Firewalls</li>
				<li>Brute Force Defence</li>
				<li>Virus Scanning</li>
				<li>Server Hardening</li>
				<li>Security Monitoring</li>
			</ul>
		These controls often interfered with the scanning activities undertaken for this report by generating error messages and CAPTCHA challenges, as shown in Image 1. 
		Access to the site was sometimes blocked too, causing scanning to abort. In order to avoid permanent blocks, tests were carried out using various virtual private 
		network (VPN) services.
		<br><br>
		We could also not confirm the vulnerabilities introduced by improper log configurations or insecure website design (OWASP TOP 10 2021 categories 4 and 9); this would 
		require additional access to the page’s Admin panel, its code and database. This is out of scope for this executive summary, however, it should be considered when 
		conducting any future assessments as an improvement.
		<img class="img-responsive" alt="" src="./network and information security management/unit 11/Figure 2.png"></p>
		<p><b>Results of Scanning Activities</b>
		<br><br>
		The scans performed using tools in Table 1 detected various high, medium, low risks. However, this section focuses on the weaknesses with the 
		highest likelihood as per OWASP Top 10 and risks from the Design document to determine the loadedwithstuff.co.uk attack surface. An example of different risk level 
		alerts detected by OWASP ZAP and HostedScan Security can be seen in Figure 3. The scope of scan of the two tools and difference in versions is responsible for the 
		difference in the results.

		A shortlist of discovered security exposures (new and previously identified) in Table 2 have been ranked using the DREAD risk ranking methodology (University of Essex 
		Online, 2022), where 0 is no risk and 3 is high risk. The risk ranking will be used for deriving the recommendations’ business priority. Figure 4 visualises the number 
		of vulnerabilities against each DREAD risk level.
