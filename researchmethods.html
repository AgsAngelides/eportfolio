		<h3>Introduction to the module</h3>
		<p>This module aims to provide students with a practical foundation in research methods which should enable us to conduct research in pratical setting. The module 
		will introduce us to various research techniques. It also provides an essential insight into the legal, social, ethical and professional issues applicable to the 
		computing projects.</p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>In the Unit 1 of the Research methods module the aim is to for us learn more of the elements within the scientific method and to introduce us to the various aspects 
	of ethical issues in research and professional practice. Upon the completion of this unit we should also be able to differentiate between the inductive and deductive reasoning.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Initial forum post</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>I have chosen a case study on the abusive workplace behaviour (ACM, 2022) which analysis an Information Technology work environment where the Technical Team Leader 
		(Max) abuses his power in the workplace by claiming the credit for all the teamwork, berating employees, and potentially discriminating against female co-workers.</p>
		<p>The sex related discrimination is not only un-ethical but also against a law within many countries. In the UK sex falls under one of the ‘protected characteristics’ in 
		the Equality Act 2010 (Citizens Advice, 2022). The US has the Civil Rights Act of 1964 where under the Title VII people cannot be treated differently because of their sex 
		(EEOC, 2022). Many other countries also have similar laws. This type of discrimination also falls under the principle’s ‘You make IT for everyone’ third point within the 
		BCS Code of Conduct (2022) where the IT professionals are expected to conduct their work without discrimination.</p>
		<p>In addition to the 3rd point of the first principle within the Code of Conduct above, The Technical Team Leader also violated the fourth principle of the same Conduct 
		where the person is expected to support their IT colleagues in their professional and personal growth.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Reflective activity</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>For the purpose of this reflective piece, it has been assumed that the computing professional in question is employed within a UK based medical publishing and training 
		company which collects a variety of user data by allowing the medical professionals to access all the content free of charge as long as they register and supply some 
		personal data such as the contact information, their job title and place of work, etc. In addition to the healthcare professional user base, data is also collected and 
		stored of all the content producers, such as the paper authors.</p>
		<p>Information technology ethical issues listed within the paper by Read Stahl et al (2016) have been reviewed and the following six issues have been selected as the most 
		relevant ones for the type of business being analysed in this piece of work:
			<ul>
				<li>Privacy – the organisation collects personal data of the healthcare professionals and other researchers and educational professionals and so the ethics related 
				to the data privacy must be a top priority.</li>
				<li>Trust/Research Ethics/ Harm, misuse, deception – the following three ethical issues have been deemed important because the company is a go to source for most 
				recent medical information by many healthcare professionals. Because of it, the business must ensure any content is trustworthy, does not deceive and that it has 
				been produced whilst following appropriate research ethics.</li>
				<li>Education related issues – the education provided must not place certain social classes or people with disabilities at a disadvantage. The business must also 
				consider how they can make sure that they do not become a ‘certificate factory’ where the professionals gain very little knowledge due to bypasses available within 
				the system which permits them completing courses with little effort thus potentially endangering the patients.</li>
				<li>Moral values and duties – due to the role the business plays in maintaining the doctors’ accreditations, it has a moral duty in ensuring the content used for 
				the accreditation is factually correct, accurate and that it won’t cause any harm if applied on patients.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>As an Information Technology professional working within the company, there are three types of actions one could take to ensure the ethical issues have been addressed:
			<ul>
				<li>Legal</li>
				<li>Technical</li>
				<li>Process</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>There is a variety of Data Privacy regulations in play worldwide which protect the user data and ensures that this data is stored and processed securely. In the UK, 
		this is regulated by the ICO and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (2022). The UK GDPR acts almost as a ‘cheat sheet’ in making sure the companies consider every 
		aspect of the customer/user data privacy, including the data privacy and user consent. Thus, for a company such as the one discussed in this work, which collects a lot of 
		sensitive user data, the UK GDPR (or its equivalent applicable to the jurisdiction the business operates in) must be implemented.</p>
		<p>The online education has been argued to support equality better due to its ability to provide education to the people regardless of their location, economical status, 
		discrimination, employment status (Brey, 2006). However, it has also been argued that online education due its requirement of technology devices can introduce extra 
		hurdles for the people who were already lacking access to the devices or skills of how to use them (Gladieux & Swail, 1999) thus placing these people at even greater 
		disadvantage. There are other things to consider too. Some studies showed there is a gender gap in technology usage, as well as a divide between the economic status 
		and race (Cooper & Weaver, 2003).</p>
		<p>Whilst there is not a lot that an IT professional at such online education business could do to address the equality ethical issues discussed above, the application 
		used for training could be made more accessible and easier to use for those lacking the computer literacy and those with the disabilities. For example, the UK government 
		provides a helpful list of Dos and Don’ts for designing accessible online content to enable people with dyslexia, visual impairment, and autism, for example, to be able 
		to access the information easier (gov.uk, 2016). Whilst for non-public sector organisations these changes are not mandated by law in the UK (gov.uk, 2022), due to business 
		delivering an important education needed to better the healthcare practitioners and the impact it can have on a wider society as a whole, the IT professional within the 
		business should ensure that the education platform meets the accessibility criteria wherever possible.</p>
		<p>The ethical issues of the trust in the content as well as the reliability of it and the research ethics of the content authors are extremely applicable to this type of 
		business. There aren’t many actions an IT professional within the business could take to ensure the content produced by various authors is not biased and is reliable. Any 
		content verification would have to be done as part of the content review process by the relevant teams within the business, such as, ensuring the author belongs to relevant 
		professional bodies with Codes of Conduct which follows closely the business code of conduct or that the author during the research followed Responsible Research and 
		Innovation (RRI) practices (RRI, 2022). However, an IT professional could, if the educational content or the papers are being submitted within the platform, install 
		tools to help the teams to ensure the content is not plagiarised, provide feedback features allowing the users to review the content flagging any inappropriate material 
		and develop built in submission disclaimers where the authors confirm the research has been performed ethically and it is not biased by anyone or anything.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>This week's reading included an article on the ethics vs morals (2018), the principles of the BCS code of conduct (2021).</p>
		<p>The reading materials on the ethics vs morals were thought provoking and built a compeling argument on why these two topics are very important in the IT industry with 
		the help of examples, such as white hat hacking. The author implied that since there are many IT professionals who ar enot part of any proffesional IT body, they are likely 
		not following the ethical principles that the IT person should follow. I do not know if I agree with this point. After having read on the 4 principles of the BCS code of conduct 
		I cannot say that most of the IT professionals are not already behaving according to this conduct. Many company policies stipulate the points made by the BCS code of conduct, as 
		well as laws such as the GDPR, DPA. So the combination of a variety of laws, employer policies and the own morals I think covers most of these code of conduct points. 
		<br>
		That said, the BCS code of conduct does include a few points that the IT professionals may know about, but may not think it applies to all of them, such as continuous learning 
		and being a role model. Hence, I do see the benefit, but I do not agree that it is a Wild West out there in the IT world because most of the IT professionals do not belong to the 
		professional bodies.</p>
		<p>An article on the research by the QuestionPro (2021) has also provided a good overview how the Inductive and Deductive Research methods are related to the Qualitative and 
		Quantitative research. It has also introduced some good pointers on the steps that each type of research should address and the characteristics of a good research, such as 
		the ethics of the researcher, since we would not want a ppaer published where the results are in favour of something which does not reflect the reality.
		<br>
		This need for ethics in IT, especially when researching and developing new ICT products is further highlighted by another article we had to read (Nulli et al, 2018) which 
		introduces us to the Responsible Research and Innovation concept (RRI). The RRI aims to ensure that the researchers ask the right questions when developing a new IT 
		product to ensure that they have considered every impact they can invisige that their product could have. The article has also provided some practical knowledge, which I 
		found helpful: in the UK we have a project called ORBIT which you can contact to help you to perform RRI in your research project.</p>
		<p>The book by Dawson et al (2016) has further cemented by understanding on the deductive vs indutive reasoning and how it fits within the research project. It also provided 
		some other helpful tips on other research techniques such as the random guesses (similar to brainstroming solutions), partition (splitting problem into smaller parts), inversion 
		(analysing the things from the opposite angle), etc.
		<br>
		It also further analysed the ethical issues in the IT industry and split it into 3 categories: those arising from how the research is performed, how the participans are dealt with 
		and how the research results are presented. I have to admit, whilst I knew of most of the issues discussed by the author, I have never before put all them together as part of 
		a single process, for example, when completing a research project as part of your PhD. Ensuring all ecthical aspects are addressed requires a lot of work and pergaps this is 
		why organisations such as the ORBIT are more important than ever to ensure the research is conducted responsibly.
		<p>The papers by Vanclay et al (2013) delved into the subject of ethics in research more and discussed the necessary for overal ethical principles applicable to anyone working 
		in research despite of their affiliations to any institutions and their institutional codes of conduct. It also brings up some other valid points, such as the differences 
		between the different institution code of conduct and the different approaches each take to create one; some focus on prevention of malpractice, for example, others are more 
		inspirational. However, the authors argue, that perhaps the practitioners should use their own ethical compass in deciding how to address micro situations themselves instead of 
		having to create guidelines for every such situation and learn to defend micro decissions made at macro level.
		<br>
		The paper also provides an overview of all ethics subjects that should be addressed by the researchers when dealing with humans and how the 'research' term has expanded and now 
		covers many more subjects, as well as private research or a creation of some 'novel ides', as the authors put it.</p>
		<p>In this unit I have also had to submit an Initial forum post on my chosen case study analysing the ethics within the work environment. My chosen case was about the abusive 
		behaviour of a team leader and the same team leader's discriminatory treatment of women at the workplace. I chose this case study, because I have very strong opinions when 
		it comes to equal rights of women. There are many other things happening in the world threatening many of the rights the women have fought for years and so this was a close to 
		heart subject. Althoigh, the preparation for this post was a straight forward one since I am quite familiar with various laws which guard the women rights. Although, the 
		interesting part was trying to work out where exactly the BCS code of conduct was being violated and apply it in practice.</p>
		<p>A reflection piece also had to be written where we, as an IT professional of a fictional IT company had to discuss the ethical issues and think of the actions we could 
		take to address these. I enjoyed the researching for it, despite there being a lack of academic research into some of the ethics fields, like the ethics related to online 
		education, which was one of the ethics issues I chose to analyse since my chosen fictional business was an online education and medical publishing organisation.</p>
		<p>Overall, this module has been very busy. Many things going on, many non-formative assignments, many items on the reading list. However, I have enjoyed learning more of 
		the law aspect of the security which I think many cyber professionals need to be aware of.</p>
