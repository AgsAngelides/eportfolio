		<h3>Introduction to the module</h3>
		<p>This module aims to provide students with a practical foundation in research methods which should enable us to conduct research in practical setting. The module 
		will introduce us to various research techniques. It also provides an essential insight into the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues applicable to the 
		computing projects.</p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The aim of the Unit 1 for us learn more of the elements within the scientific method and to introduce us to the various aspects 
	of ethical issues in research and professional practice. Upon the completion of this unit we should also be able to differentiate between the inductive and deductive reasoning.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Reflective activity</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>For the purpose of this reflective piece, it has been assumed that the computing professional in question is employed within a UK based medical publishing and training 
		company which collects a variety of user data by allowing the medical professionals to access all the content free of charge as long as they register and supply some 
		personal data such as the contact information, their job title and place of work, etc. In addition to the healthcare professional user base, data is also collected and 
		stored of all the content producers, such as the paper authors.</p>
		<p>Information technology ethical issues listed within the paper by Read Stahl et al (2016) have been reviewed and the following six issues have been selected as the most 
		relevant ones for the type of business being analysed in this piece of work:
			<ul>
				<li>Privacy – the organisation collects personal data of the healthcare professionals and other researchers and educational professionals and so the ethics related 
				to the data privacy must be a top priority.</li>
				<li>Trust/Research Ethics/ Harm, misuse, deception – the following three ethical issues have been deemed important because the company is a go to source for most 
				recent medical information by many healthcare professionals. Because of it, the business must ensure any content is trustworthy, does not deceive and that it has 
				been produced whilst following appropriate research ethics.</li>
				<li>Education related issues – the education provided must not place certain social classes or people with disabilities at a disadvantage. The business must also 
				consider how they can make sure that they do not become a ‘certificate factory’ where the professionals gain very little knowledge due to bypasses available within 
				the system which permits them completing courses with little effort thus potentially endangering the patients.</li>
				<li>Moral values and duties – due to the role the business plays in maintaining the doctors’ accreditations, it has a moral duty in ensuring the content used for 
				the accreditation is factually correct, accurate and that it won’t cause any harm if applied on patients.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>As an Information Technology professional working within the company, there are three types of actions one could take to ensure the ethical issues have been addressed:
			<ul>
				<li>Legal</li>
				<li>Technical</li>
				<li>Process</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>There is a variety of Data Privacy regulations in play worldwide which protect the user data and ensures that this data is stored and processed securely. In the UK, 
		this is regulated by the ICO and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (2022). The UK GDPR acts almost as a ‘cheat sheet’ in making sure the companies consider every 
		aspect of the customer/user data privacy, including the data privacy and user consent. Thus, for a company such as the one discussed in this work, which collects a lot of 
		sensitive user data, the UK GDPR (or its equivalent applicable to the jurisdiction the business operates in) must be implemented.</p>
		<p>The online education has been argued to support equality better due to its ability to provide education to the people regardless of their location, economical status, 
		discrimination, employment status (Brey, 2006). However, it has also been argued that online education due its requirement of technology devices can introduce extra 
		hurdles for the people who were already lacking access to the devices or skills of how to use them (Gladieux & Swail, 1999) thus placing these people at even greater 
		disadvantage. There are other things to consider too. Some studies showed there is a gender gap in technology usage, as well as a divide between the economic status 
		and race (Cooper & Weaver, 2003).</p>
		<p>Whilst there is not a lot that an IT professional at such online education business could do to address the equality ethical issues discussed above, the application 
		used for training could be made more accessible and easier to use for those lacking the computer literacy and those with the disabilities. For example, the UK government 
		provides a helpful list of Dos and Don’ts for designing accessible online content to enable people with dyslexia, visual impairment, and autism, for example, to be able 
		to access the information easier (gov.uk, 2016). Whilst for non-public sector organisations these changes are not mandated by law in the UK (gov.uk, 2022), due to business 
		delivering an important education needed to better the healthcare practitioners and the impact it can have on a wider society as a whole, the IT professional within the 
		business should ensure that the education platform meets the accessibility criteria wherever possible.</p>
		<p>The ethical issues of the trust in the content as well as the reliability of it and the research ethics of the content authors are extremely applicable to this type of 
		business. There aren’t many actions an IT professional within the business could take to ensure the content produced by various authors is not biased and is reliable. Any 
		content verification would have to be done as part of the content review process by the relevant teams within the business, such as, ensuring the author belongs to relevant 
		professional bodies with Codes of Conduct which follows closely the business code of conduct or that the author during the research followed Responsible Research and 
		Innovation (RRI) practices (RRI, 2022). However, an IT professional could, if the educational content or the papers are being submitted within the platform, install 
		tools to help the teams to ensure the content is not plagiarised, provide feedback features allowing the users to review the content flagging any inappropriate material 
		and develop built in submission disclaimers where the authors confirm the research has been performed ethically and it is not biased by anyone or anything.</p>

		<p>I have chosen to address the following question: What is the optimal password length for protecting one’s account?</p>
		<p>Upon doing some research, the following two papers have been chosen to conduct a review on: a paper by Stainbrook et al (2018) and a paper by Hussain (2022) both 
		discussing the user account passwords and best practices as well as its limitations.</p>
		<p>Stainbrook et all (2018) have investigated the reasons behind using the passwords people use and the reasons behind trading security for more memorable passwords. The 
		information was obtained by conducting a qualitative survey of open ended questions and then conducting a quantitative data analysis as well as deductive reasoning.</p>
		<p>The paper by Hussain (2022), on the other hand, conducts a qualitative literature review to find out more information about the users and their password practices as well 
		as the recommendations on how the current practices could be improved to better the security.</p>
		<p>Both authors are using the correct research methods, in my opinion. The paper by Stainbrook is trying to find out of the user password practices first hand whilst the 
		other author is reviewing what is already done on the subject. I do, however, think that the questionnaire conducted by the authors of the first paper did not obtain a lot 
		of new data I have not previously seen in already existing research. So perhaps conducting a research review first to find out whether a new questionnaire and data analysis 
		is required would have been beneficial.</p>
		<p>The author which conducted the literature review of the existing papers could have also provided analysis of where the research could go next and potentially identify any 
		further research opportunities within the paper’s conclusions.</p>

		<p>Since completing the ‘Humans factor’ module and having read somewhere that women and men use the same software differently based on its design and structure, I had this 
		idea that I wanted to explore how our biology determines how we use the software, if we could design it with the sex differences in mind and whether this could also have an 
		impact on improving the security.</p>
		<p>I think to achieve what I am trying to achieve, I will first use the Exploratory research design method (BRM, 2018) to explore how our sex related biology impacts how we 
		perceive things.</p>
		<p>I will then use the deductive reasoning to shortlist the information from the Exploratory research which could be applied to the UX design of a software. For this I will 
		have to conduct the review of the existing research and evaluate it qualitatively.</p>
		<p>Then I will apply the Conclusive research method (BRM, 2018), causal research category and design a questionnaire/survey which will present the participants (both men 
		and women) the UX wireframes prepared of various situations (such as the error messages, system notifications, etc) and ask them to evaluate their choices based on various 
		scenarios.</p>
		<p>Lastly, I would quantitively analyse the results of the survey/questionnaire to determine if a particular sex prefers certain designs, whether the psychology predicted 
		responses apply to the UX design, etc.</p>

		<p>This week's reading materials (BRM, 2018) and the e-portfolio activity helped me to critically evaluate my approach to the research methodology. 
		Up until now, I haven't given it much though and my approach to completion of this assignment would have probably been very unstructured. However, having read all the materials, 
		taking some time to plan it out and to structure my approach will save time and produce a better quality work.</p>
		<p>Also, whilst writing my Summary Post, I have caught myself thinking more about criticality of my post and whether my post is biased by own views or whether it is reflecting 
		the research I have used. Having this module focus on the academic integrity and ethical research practices is already having an impact on the quality of the work I deliver.</p>

		<p>Since I am likely to use a questionnaire for my master’s project, I must ensure I determine the correct sample size.

Thus, next week I am researching more on how to determine an appropriate sample size.</p>
		<p>This unit’s reflective activity has also highlighted the importance of preparing the survey without bias and prejudice, showcasing how a biased survey could not only impact the results making it completely unusable, but also impact the participant’s perception of your professionalism, making them less/more willing to participate in the survey.

		<p>I was planning on collecting data in two ways:

		<p>The data analysis will be both qualitative and quantitative. For example, I will do a qualitative data analysis of various papers to determine the way 
			women and men perceive UX based on how our biology works. Once I have various ideas, I will propose the UX design improvements and prepare some wireframes to 
			demonstrate it. Then I would prepare a questionnaire for my survey which would aim to verify whether my hypothesis is true or false and the questionnaire results

		<p>This unit, as if responding to my reflections from the previous week, has given me with some useful information on how I could ensure the quality and ethics within any survey whilst also providing an opportunity to apply these skills in practice by analysing other existing surveys.</p>

		<p>The small response rate highlighted in the book (Dawson, 2015) is, however, a little worrying. I was imagining surveys would be distributed online, hence I may need to engage my LinkedIn audiences as well as the local community members to get a good variety of responses; I must brainstorm on some ideas on how to get the participant numbers I require.</p>

		<p>I will have to be careful with the Interpretative Validity of the MSc project since it relies on interpreting psychology related information and applying it to the UX design, and it is very easy for one to interpret the data incorrectly and deduce something completely wrong.</p>
		<p>I have also started looking at the sample size required for my master's project. Based on the information from this unit, I will need to ensure the equal split between women and men and consider other demographic aspects too, to get as close to the general population representation as possible.</p>
		<p>Kaplan & Maxwell (2005) have further suggested the use of the open ended questions to explore other ideas that the researchers have not anticipated; this is certainly something I should implement to understand better how different sexes perceive the same design.</p>
		<p>Whilst the Literature review research was interesting, I found the discussion and critical appraisal aspects a little more challenging; I wanted to ensure I do not mispresent the author's thoughts. This was a great practice for the master's research project.</p>

		<p>The data analysis guidance provided by Berenson et al (2015) was useful and whilst the mean and median concepts are not new to me (I used it for the gender pay gap analysis within the Literature review), the variance and the standard deviation is not something I have used since my undergraduate degree, and I will need to refresh my knowledge before working on my master's thesis.</p>
		<p>Since working on the research proposal outline, I now also have a better understanding on the difference between the project’s aim, objectives, and questions, which is going to beneficial in the following module.</p>
		<p>Moreover, the feedback received on my Literature review was encouraging, although, I was a little concerned with the comments regarding the plagiarism. I always submit my work through Turnitin first before any submission, and I did see some highlighted text, however, these were very common phrases which you come across all the time, and it is my opinion, that the common way of saying things should not be included in the plagiarism checks.</p>

		<p>After completing this week's worksheets, I feel more confident in my ability to analyse data. Whilst I use Excel every day, there were some helpful statistical analysis pointers, such as how to use the Frequency function or work out the class mark.</p>
		<p>Another surprising discovery made during this unit, was regarding the conversion of the Qualitative data to the 'numbers'. I would have never thought it is considered a poor practice when conducting research (Learning for Action, n.d) - something to keep in mind for my future master's project. It is advised to quote the participant's thoughts instead of summarising it in, percentages, for example.</p>
		<p>The research proposal outline feedback I have received from the tutor in this unit was positive overall. I think perhaps next time, when submitting the outline, I must be clearer regarding the primary research and that it won't be conducted as part of this proposal.</p>

		<p>This week I have learnt that it is a good practice to include information on who would find the research useful within the introduction (Dawson, 2015), which I will aim to implement in my future work.</p>
		<p>Also, interestingly, whilst reading on good Abstract writing practices, I initially thought the incorrectly written abstract was the better one; many papers I read previously have had their Abstracts written in that way. This makes me wonder whether there are different standards and preferences, or whether those other papers I have read were just poorly written.</p>
		<p>I have thoroughly enjoyed writing the research proposal on the topic I chose. Not only had I found it interesting, but it has also impacted me professionally; now when I design the UX, I consider genders and the different impact the same UX design could have on different genders.</p>

		<p>Because of this week’s reading material, I had a thought a lot about how I could implement it into my career. Having worked in the recruitment, I do not agree with 
		Weber’s (2018) statement regarding its usefulness in the initial candidate selection process, due to the time constraints and the recruiters not being familiar with the intricates of every job position, 
		however, I agree it can be useful later in the recruitment process to showcase all skills in more detail whilst keeping the resume brief and to the point.</p>
		<p>Towards the end of the unit, I have received feedback on my research proposal submission and some umbrella feedback on the discussion forum posts. Most of it was helpful and I will make sure to incorporate the 
		suggestions in future, however, I do not quite agree with having to incorporate references into your spoken presentation. During the previous modules, this was not a 
		requirement and neither it is applied to the lecturecasts. I think the university could benefit from ensuring all learning materials and every module's requirements 
		are synced with the assignment grading criteria.</p>

		<p>As a current IT Project Manager, I disagree with some of the author conclusions in this week’s reading. I felt Marichetty’s (2017) data analysis was lacking; the participant’s employer size and the industry were unclear.  In my experience, small businesses tend to have less cloud experienced IT teams and so it would have been beneficial to provide correlation between the business’ size and the respondent’s answers.</p>
		<p>Moreover, the Mircea’s paper on the project management (2019) techniques feels somewhat outdated; companies nowadays, in my experience, are using a mix of methodologies for both the Business as Usual delivery as well as the larger projects. The Agile methodology popularity is slowing down too, since it is lacking planning and careful considerations of the customer's needs (Bryar & Carr, 2021).</p>
		<p>A quiz we completed this week asked us to select an inappropriate method for identifying risks; the correct answer turned out to be ‘Web browsing’. I understand why this may not be the best method as it could lead to identifying non-applicable risks, however, I do not agree it is a wrong method. For a small business with limited budget and less experienced team, resources available on the internet is a great starting point.</p>
