		<h3>Introduction to the module</h3>
		<p>This module aims to provide students with a practical foundation in research methods which should enable us to conduct research in pratical setting. The module 
		will introduce us to various research techniques. It also provides an essential insight into the legal, social, ethical and professional issues applicable to the 
		computing projects.</p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>In the Unit 1 of the Research methods module the aim is to for us learn more of the elements within the scientific method and to introduce us to the various aspects 
	of ethical issues in research and professional practice. Upon the completion of this unit we should also be able to differentiate between the inductive and deductive reasoning.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Reflective activity</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>For the purpose of this reflective piece, it has been assumed that the computing professional in question is employed within a UK based medical publishing and training 
		company which collects a variety of user data by allowing the medical professionals to access all the content free of charge as long as they register and supply some 
		personal data such as the contact information, their job title and place of work, etc. In addition to the healthcare professional user base, data is also collected and 
		stored of all the content producers, such as the paper authors.</p>
		<p>Information technology ethical issues listed within the paper by Read Stahl et al (2016) have been reviewed and the following six issues have been selected as the most 
		relevant ones for the type of business being analysed in this piece of work:
			<ul>
				<li>Privacy – the organisation collects personal data of the healthcare professionals and other researchers and educational professionals and so the ethics related 
				to the data privacy must be a top priority.</li>
				<li>Trust/Research Ethics/ Harm, misuse, deception – the following three ethical issues have been deemed important because the company is a go to source for most 
				recent medical information by many healthcare professionals. Because of it, the business must ensure any content is trustworthy, does not deceive and that it has 
				been produced whilst following appropriate research ethics.</li>
				<li>Education related issues – the education provided must not place certain social classes or people with disabilities at a disadvantage. The business must also 
				consider how they can make sure that they do not become a ‘certificate factory’ where the professionals gain very little knowledge due to bypasses available within 
				the system which permits them completing courses with little effort thus potentially endangering the patients.</li>
				<li>Moral values and duties – due to the role the business plays in maintaining the doctors’ accreditations, it has a moral duty in ensuring the content used for 
				the accreditation is factually correct, accurate and that it won’t cause any harm if applied on patients.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>As an Information Technology professional working within the company, there are three types of actions one could take to ensure the ethical issues have been addressed:
			<ul>
				<li>Legal</li>
				<li>Technical</li>
				<li>Process</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>There is a variety of Data Privacy regulations in play worldwide which protect the user data and ensures that this data is stored and processed securely. In the UK, 
		this is regulated by the ICO and the UK General Data Protection Regulation (2022). The UK GDPR acts almost as a ‘cheat sheet’ in making sure the companies consider every 
		aspect of the customer/user data privacy, including the data privacy and user consent. Thus, for a company such as the one discussed in this work, which collects a lot of 
		sensitive user data, the UK GDPR (or its equivalent applicable to the jurisdiction the business operates in) must be implemented.</p>
		<p>The online education has been argued to support equality better due to its ability to provide education to the people regardless of their location, economical status, 
		discrimination, employment status (Brey, 2006). However, it has also been argued that online education due its requirement of technology devices can introduce extra 
		hurdles for the people who were already lacking access to the devices or skills of how to use them (Gladieux & Swail, 1999) thus placing these people at even greater 
		disadvantage. There are other things to consider too. Some studies showed there is a gender gap in technology usage, as well as a divide between the economic status 
		and race (Cooper & Weaver, 2003).</p>
		<p>Whilst there is not a lot that an IT professional at such online education business could do to address the equality ethical issues discussed above, the application 
		used for training could be made more accessible and easier to use for those lacking the computer literacy and those with the disabilities. For example, the UK government 
		provides a helpful list of Dos and Don’ts for designing accessible online content to enable people with dyslexia, visual impairment, and autism, for example, to be able 
		to access the information easier (gov.uk, 2016). Whilst for non-public sector organisations these changes are not mandated by law in the UK (gov.uk, 2022), due to business 
		delivering an important education needed to better the healthcare practitioners and the impact it can have on a wider society as a whole, the IT professional within the 
		business should ensure that the education platform meets the accessibility criteria wherever possible.</p>
		<p>The ethical issues of the trust in the content as well as the reliability of it and the research ethics of the content authors are extremely applicable to this type of 
		business. There aren’t many actions an IT professional within the business could take to ensure the content produced by various authors is not biased and is reliable. Any 
		content verification would have to be done as part of the content review process by the relevant teams within the business, such as, ensuring the author belongs to relevant 
		professional bodies with Codes of Conduct which follows closely the business code of conduct or that the author during the research followed Responsible Research and 
		Innovation (RRI) practices (RRI, 2022). However, an IT professional could, if the educational content or the papers are being submitted within the platform, install 
		tools to help the teams to ensure the content is not plagiarised, provide feedback features allowing the users to review the content flagging any inappropriate material 
		and develop built in submission disclaimers where the authors confirm the research has been performed ethically and it is not biased by anyone or anything.</p>

		<p>I have chosen to address the following question: What is the optimal password length for protecting one’s account?</p>
		<p>Upon doing some research, the following two papers have been chosen to conduct a review on: a paper by Stainbrook et al (2018) and a paper by Hussain (2022) both 
		discussing the user account passwords and best practices as well as its limitations.</p>
		<p>Stainbrook et all (2018) have investigated the reasons behind using the passwords people use and the reasons behind trading security for more memorable passwords. The 
		information was obtained by conducting a qualitative survey of open ended questions and then conducting a quantitative data analysis as well as deductive reasoning.</p>
		<p>The paper by Hussain (2022), on the other hand, conducts a qualitative literature review to find out more information about the users and their password practices as well 
		as the recommendations on how the current practices could be improved to better the security.</p>
		<p>Both authors are using the correct research methods, in my opinion. The paper by Stainbrook is trying to find out of the user password practices first hand whilst the 
		other author is reviewing what is already done on the subject. I do, however, think that the questionnaire conducted by the authors of the first paper did not obtain a lot 
		of new data I have not previously seen in already existing research. So perhaps conducting a research review first to find out whether a new questionnaire and data analysis 
		is required would have been beneficial.</p>
		<p>The author which conducted the literature review of the existing papers could have also provided analysis of where the research could go next and potentially identify any 
		further research opportunities within the paper’s conclusions.</p>

		<p>This module felt a little daunting at the start: I did not know what to expect from the Literature review. However, all the reading materials (Healey et al, 2015) in this module and how the module 
		itself is structured helped me to work out the requirements of the submissions. The reading materials by Dawson (2015) have also enouraged me to start thinking about my 
		research project and how will I conduct it as up until this point in the course I had an idea I wanted to reseach, but I did not consider the methods I would use to do it.</p>

		<p>Since completing the ‘Humans factor’ module and having read somewhere that women and men use the same software differently based on its design and structure, I had this 
		idea that I wanted to explore how our biology determines how we use the software, if we could design it with the sex differences in mind and whether this could also have an 
		impact on improving the security.</p>
		<p>I think to achieve what I am trying to achieve, I will first use the Exploratory research design method (BRM, 2018) to explore how our sex related biology impacts how we 
		perceive things.</p>
		<p>I will then use the deductive reasoning to shortlist the information from the Exploratory research which could be applied to the UX design of a software. For this I will 
		have to conduct the review of the existing research and evaluate it qualitatively.</p>
		<p>Then I will apply the Conclusive research method (BRM, 2018), causal research category and design a questionnaire/survey which will present the participants (both men 
		and women) the UX wireframes prepared of various situations (such as the error messages, system notifications, etc) and ask them to evaluate their choices based on various 
		scenarios.</p>
		<p>Lastly, I would quantitively analyse the results of the survey/questionnaire to determine if a particular sex prefers certain designs, whether the psychology predicted 
		responses apply to the UX design, etc.</p>

		<p>We have looked at the research methods most commonly used in the projects, one of them being an experiment (Dawson, 205). If I designed UX wireframes to confirm my hypothesis 
		that women and men have different UX design preferences and asked the participants to select an option in a survey/questionnaire, would it be considered to fall under both the Experiment and 
		Survey research method or only survey? I think, the answe is yes. Both research method characteristics described in the book appear to match my project plan.</p>
