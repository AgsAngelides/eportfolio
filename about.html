    <h1>Hello, I'm Ags!</h1>
    
    <p>My birth name is actually Agne Angelides, however, I have been known as Ags for the past 10 years and Agne is now something only used by my mother and grandma 
	or those who want to offend me. To help new people I meet to remember my name, I often say it's like 'Bacon and Ags'. 
	I moved to the UK 10 years ago from a small Baltic country Lithuania. We Lithuanians are hardworking and can be proud people. 
	We also often say what we think, which I found often gets me into interesting situations.
	I currently reside in the naval heart of England - Portsmouth, which Dickens found remarkable for the amount mud and sailors once.</p>
    
    <h3>My background </h3>

    <p>In 2017 I have graduated from the university of Southampton where I have achieved BSc in Physics (Hons). 
	Since then I have been working as a Project Mananger/Business analyst on various Information Technology projects for a small family like IT business. </p>

    <h3>Time for interesting facts about me!</h3>
    
    <p>I am a member of a very large family, some might say. In addition my husband and my often difficult teenager stepson, there are 5 other family members:
	Mimi (ginger bunny), Patch (grey bunny), Choco (an Oriental cat), Kit (a large Maine coon) and Autumn (a red standard poodle). Our friends call us a 'mini-zoo' and think we should start charging for a petting experience.</p>
   
   <h3>Interests </h3>
   
    <p>I like to keep myself busy (all the time). These days I enjoy running, riding my bike and reading.
	Me and Autumn (poodle) are also currently working towards achieving gold obedience certificate and we will start preparing for Agility competitions soon.
	When I get inspired, I will get my easel out and add another painting to our collection. </p>
