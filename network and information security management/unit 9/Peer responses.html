<h3>Peer response from Andrijana Klacar (2022)</h3>
	<p>Hi Ags,
	<br><br>
	Interesting choice of case study. Although I had an idea of how 'dangerous' in terms of privacy social media is, I have realised during this course that anything virtualised will probably always be lacking completely privacy. Social media is anything but private and it is becoming a huge problem for people who would like to have more privacy (Suciu, 2020). 
	<br><br>
	GDPR provided users with more transparency, awareness and trust from the users (insightsoftware, 2018). Although, GDPR does not apply for users on social media who are logged for their own purposes, but it does apply for organisations who misuse personal data on the platforms. Organisations should monitor their employees and protect their data from being breached (VinciWorks, 2018).
	<br><br>
	I am curious as to which sections of the data protection act the employee breached in your case study mentioned.

	Hi Andrijana,
	<br><br>
	thank you for your response.
	<br><br>
	I agree, social media is becoming an issue for many individuals. You have also rightfully stated that in most cases GDPR does not apply to an individual on social media. However, it does apply in some instances.
	<br><br>
	Reading the case study (Data Protection Commission, 2017), the company being investigated had the policy in place disallowing the use of personal mobile devices. So the employee in question has violated the companies policy (and presumably, their own contract) by taking a photograph of a company document during the working hours.
	<br><br>
	Secondly, whilst the GDPR does not apply to the individuals directly, an individual could still be fined if they are breaking a particular GDPR related point written into the country's laws. For example, the said employee was breaking DPA's section 170 regarding the unlawful obtaining of personal data (cps, 2018), i.e. they used a device which was not allowed to obtain a photograph of a file containing personal data.
	<br><br>
	That said, my initial post was discussing the company itself breaking the UK's version of the  GDPR by not implementing sufficient security controls as per the chosen case study.

	Hi Ags,
	<br><br>
	This case highlights the fact once again, that a lot of security is about processes, procedures, and the human element. 
	<br><br>
	It is worth considering how the data itself can be encoded as part of security precautions as well as looking at alternative mechanisms that may be usable.
	<br><br>
	Regards, Beran

	Hi Beran,
	<br><br>
	Thank you for your response.

	I agree, in most cases, data encryption could be an option. However, when it comes to the recruitment, I don't think that is a viable business option for the majority of businesses, especially when we are discussing small to mid size companies conducting their own recruitment. I am going to talk here a lot from my own experience from when I dabbled in recruitment a few years ago.
	<br><br>
	The recruitment in smaller companies is more informal, CVs and cover letters are emailed to a Hiring Manager/HR department, where they are reviewed and either the candidate is shortlisted or the CV is disposed of.
	<br><br>
	Sometimes, the emailed resume could be passed around too, from the HR department to, for example, the actual manager or team leader, etc.
	<br><br>
	So data encryption for occasional recruitment data is a lot of unnecessary work for many businesses, in my opinion.
	<br><br>
	Even within larger companies with formal recruitment processes and platforms, the managers are still printing out resumes for the interviews, for reviews, etc. An article was also written by TalentHub (Smits-Jørgensen, 2019) which discussed a statistic where 9 out of 10 managers have a CV folder somewhere.
	<br><br>
	I think many companies who are not in the recruitment business themselves, have this misconception about what constitutes a personal data, and CVs/Cover Letters somehow manage to 'escape' this classification due it being handled only occasionally. So in my opinion, the way to solve these data leaks is by implementing formal policies for handling and disposal of the employee recruitment data, even if the recruitment is carried out only occasionally.

	Once more this case features the reality, that a ton of safety is about cycles, techniques, and the human component.
	<br><br>
	It merits thinking about how the actual information can be encoded as a component of safety insurance as well as taking a gander at elective systems that might be usable.

<h3>My response to Ali's post</h3>
	<p>
	Hi Ali,
	<br><br>
	I absolutely agree. In most cases, the best security is achieved when both the policies and security tools are combined to build a good security system.
	<br><br>
	I think resumes, however, are a little more complicated. I am not aware of any way that the data in the CVs could be encrypted and stored safely. In larger companies with recruitment portals you could automatically assign confidential label to all applicant data, restrict the users access based on the label and log any such accesses. This should all be clearly stated in the companies information security policies.
	<br><br>
	When it comes to smaller businesses, however, the resumes are normally emailed. So here, I think, it will be mostly about the security policies. For example, the information security policy could define the job role of a person who can receive the resumes and is allowed to view the data. The actual soft copy storage could be restricted and there could be a policy on hard copies and on their disposal, to ensure that there is no personal data copies just sitting on someone's desk.
