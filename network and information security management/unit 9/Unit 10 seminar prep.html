<p>For the seminar in the Unit 10 preparation we had to read an article (Swinhoe, 2020) on the biggest 21st century data breaches, pick one such breach and answer the following list of questions.</p>
<p><b>What types of data were affected?</b>
<br><br>
The personal data was impacted by this breach: email addresses, IP addresses and login credentials (usernames and passwords stored in SHA-1 and bcrypt hashes). 
150 million records were stolen in total (Lukic, 2021).</p>
<p><b>What happened?</b>
<br><br>
In February 2018 the app was breached releasing a lot of personal data including usernames and passwords. Some passwords were hashed with a very weak SHA-1 algorithm. 
The company has not released any news on what caused the data breach. A month later the stolen data was found for sale on the dark web (Lukic, 2021).</p>
<p><b>Who was responsible?</b>
<br><br>
MyFitnessPal in the latest details are still unsure of who did it (myfitnesspal, 2018) or are not releasing this information.</p>
<p><b>Were any escalation(s) stopped - how?</b>#
<br><br>
They have requested the users to change their passwords (it’s not optional) to avoid further breaches and provided the customers with additional information on how to protect their data 
(myFitnessPal, 2018).</P>
<p><b>Was the Business Continuity Plan instigated?</b>
<br><br>
It is unclear if the Business Continuity plan was instigated, however, the Under Armour (owner of the MyFitnessPal) acted quickly when they were informed of the data breach and took all the correct 
steps to address the issue, such as notifying the users and relevant governing bodies, asking the users to change their passwords, continuing to monitor any suspicious activity, additional enhancements 
were added to detect and prevent unauthorised access to the user data. They have also hired data security firms to investigate this breach (myFitnessPall, 2018). All these steps could have potentially 
been part of their Business Continuity plan.</p>
<p><b>Was the ICO notified?</b>
Under armor has said that they have notified all the applicable regulatory bodies, which, I assume includes the ICO.</p>
<p><b>Were affected individuals notified?</b>
<br><br>
The customers were alerted on the 25th of March 2018.</p>
<p><b>What were the social, legal and ethical implications of the decisions made?</b>
<br><br>
The company’s share prices have dropped by 3% in after-hours trade (Guardian, 2018). I could not find any further evidence on whether there was any impact on their user base, but I assume, their 
reputation would have been impacted too.</p>
<p><b>If you had been the ISM for the organisation you selected what mitigations would you have put in place to stop any reoccurrences?</b>
<br><br>
To prevent this from happening and to limit the data exposure, I would have:
	<ul>
		<li>Hashed the passwords using stronger algorithms, such as SHA-256 or SHA-3 (Arias, 2019).</li>
		<li>Done regular system scans for any vulnerabilities that could be used to expose data.</li>
		<li>The personal data such as user emails and IP addresses could be encrypted too (Fanchi, 2021).</li>
		<li>Ensure all systems are regularly patched.</li>
		<li>Consider allowing database data access only from validated IP addresses.</li>
	</ul>
