<p>Glisson et al. (2015) in the Compromising Medical Mannequin paper reviewed the results of two malicious attacks performed by the computing students; 
  the DoS attack exploited a TCP network protocol vulnerability at the internal mannequin’s access point whilst the brute force attack was carried out by 
  abusing the 802.11 wireless transmission.</p>

<p>Specifically, the brute force attack abused the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) and its weak PIN. Since the PIN is only eight digits long and the first 
  four digits get authenticated separately from the last four, it makes it easy for a hacker to guess all the possible combinations (Hoffman, 2017). 
  It is my opinion, that the easiest way to avoid these attacks is to disable the WPS and use a strong router password instead (Cybersecurity & 
  Infrastructure Security Agency, 2013).</p>
<p>In terms of the DoS attack against the iStan’s internal access point, I agree with my peer Kevin’s (2022) views: firewalls will have no impact on security. 
  Since the ability to carry this type of attack depends on the proximity to the device as the wireless access point scanners have a range of about 45m 
  indoors (Tanaza, 2017), physical access rules may be of use in this instance; only authorised employees and students should be allowed into the building 
  where the sensitive devices are kept. The devices should also be stored more centrally within the building itself. These physical access restrictions also 
  fall within the zero-trust concept brought up by Beran (2022).</p>
<p>In addition, a firewall could be set up between the iStan and the machine that controls it (which is connected to the teaching facility’s network) and 
  only one way traffic from the machine to the mannequin could be allowed (Liebetrau, 2013). The traffic would allow for settings to be passed from the 
  machine to the mannequin, but it would stop the mannequin from reaching the main network in case of any other attacks.</p>
