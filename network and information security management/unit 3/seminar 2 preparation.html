<p>Seminar question: Would the Internet we have today be much better if it was based on the ISO/ OSI 7-layer model rather than TCP/IP?</p>
<h4>My preparation</h4>
<p>It is my opinion that the internet would not have been better off today if it had used the ISO/OSI 7-layer protocol because:
  <ul>
    <li>The slow standardisation process of the ISO/OSI-7 protocol would not have been able to keep up with the expansion of the IoT.</li>
    <li>ISO/OSI being regulated by ISO meant that there would have always been a lot of red tape for any new changes required, approvals, signoffs, etc. 
      compared to more open development environment in the TCP/IP research teams.</li>
    <li>ISO/OSI uses a Prescriptive approach vs Descriptive approach of the TSP/IP protocol, which was more suited for people actually implementing the said 
      protocol.</li>
    <li>The ‘rough consensus’ approach in the group of TCP/IP creators meant that the new updates could pass with 80%-90% approval instead of having to achieve 
      a unanimous vote. This allows for new features/changes to be implemented quicker to keep up with the ever-changing IoT.</li>
    <li>New TCP/IP change proposals must be implemented on test environments and vigorously tested before they can be applied in the ‘real’ world. ISO/OSI-7, 
      on the other hand, focuses on theoretical change proposals. The TCP/IP approach provides better security since the changes are less likely to 
      have many vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>TCP/IP uses open and decentralised technical architecture, which means anyone can propose an update, instead of just the members as in the case of 
      ISO/OSI-7.</li>
    <li>A protocol with simple implementation like the TCP/IP helped many users to have information technology environments with devices, servers, etc. from 
      different manufactures that would not have been able to communicate previously. The ISO/OSI protocol would have delayed this process.</li>
  </ul>
