	<p>Hi Agne,
	<br><br>
	Thanks for your interesting points.</p>
	<p>New research from Cyberio (2021) shows that healthcare must adopt a zero-trust architecture that will significantly reduce ransomware, outdated firmware, and unsecured services by configuring 
	policies that block unnecessary communications with healthcare devices.</p>
	<p>Any thoughts on this?

	<p>Hi Beran,
	<br><br>
	thank you for your response.</p>
	<p>I agree with the theoretical benefits of the implementation of the zero-trust architecture in the healthcare. As we know, the healthcare data is very valuable in the black market 
	fetching up to $250 per record (Taylor, 2022) because of its use in creating false identities (Campbell, 2016). Hence, authenticating devices and users, monitoring all devices and network, 
	encrypting the network, segmenting the network to wall off vulnerable devices makes sense.</p>
	<p>However, there are some concerns that instantly come to my mind. A mandatory authentication of every person/device trying to connect to the internal healthcare organisation network could create 
	unnecessary red tape: a medical professional putting in some extra hours of work from home trying to connect to the hospital's network, visiting professionals trying to access patient records, an 
	undetected legacy device trying to connect (the equipment which cannot be securely connected to the network because of its age/outdated OS, etc. (Slabodkin, 2021)), etc. There is also always a 
	concern over an incorrectly implemented architecture and the impact it could have on patients. For example, an incorrectly configured firewall used to segment the network to separate legacy medical 
	equipment could cut off these devices temporarily making them unavailable and impacting the patients (Tyler, 2021).</p>
	<p>So whilst it does carry a lot of theoretical benefits, in my opinion, there are many places where things could go wrong due to the complexity of healthcare organisations, the number of legacy devices 
	which cannot be integrated, and so risk/reward ratio should be assessed for each new control, process and/or policy.</p>

	<p>Dear Beran and Agne,
	<br><br>
	Thank you for highlighting Zero Trust Policy.</p>
	<p>Zero Trust is an interesting concept.</p>
	<p>The core concept of zero trust is simple: assume everything is hostile by default. It's a major departure from the network security model built on the centralized data center and secure network 
	perimeterâ€”a model in use since the 1990s. These network architectures rely on approved IP addresses, ports, and protocols to establish access controls and validate what's trusted inside the network, 
	generally including anybody connecting via remote access VPN.</p>
	<p>The foundations of zero trust include terminate every connection, protect data using granular context based policies and reduce risk by eliminating the attack surface. 
	This helps in reducing business and organizational risk, gain access over cloud and supports complaince initiatives.</p>

	<p>Hi Anoushka,
	<br><br>
	Thank you for sharing your thoughts. However, I don't agree that by default the zero-trust methodology will always reduce business and organisational risks. 
	I think this is highly business dependant and the networking system implemented as well as its age.</p>
	<p>As many specialist point out, it is more suitable for smaller and more modern business (Carder, 2020). As the cited article mentions, larger legacy companies will have trouble implementing 
	zero trust due to the complexity of the existing processes, connections, etc. Many healthcare institutions are such complex organisations where older technology and policies were merged with 
	the newer technology in policies whilst trying to keep up with the ever evolving world. And my personal opinion is that perhaps only some elements of the zero-trust methodology would be 
	beneficial to such institutions if at all, due to the risk of misconfiguration, incorrect network mapping, cost, etc.</p>

<p>Peer response from Ali Ahmad on my initial post.
<blockquote><cite>
	<p>I agree with your arguments that tampering with medical mannequins affects the training of medical students, which leads to incorrect diagnosis and treatment of patients. Technology is 
	taking over the production and operation of medical training devices like a mannequin, prone to cyber threats. The iStan medical mannequin is prone to DOS attacks that affect TCP network 
	protocol and brute force attacks tampering with 802.11 wireless transmissions responsible for communication between the mannequin and the control panels. When the mannequin is tampered with 
	during the production stage, it comprises the teaching, learning of medical professionals, and the investigation of these devices.</p>
	<p>The attacks against the medical mannequin are preventable by using a network firewall. This network firewall will hinder attacks from DOS that make the iStan front-end software Muse unavailable. 
	The firewall helps install a certain number of allowed incomplete TCP requests for a specific destination. It is possible through a resilient architecture, hardware, bandwidth, and outsourcing. 
	The attacks cannot continue since when the permitted number is attained, they are not processed until they are completed or when time runs out.</p>
	<p>Disabling the Wi-Fi Protected Setup feature mitigates attacks from brute force on 802.11 wireless transmissions within the radio range. It is possible because the attackers do not access the 
	Wi-Fi network, and it is impossible to attack while not in the same radio range. The regular passwords for connectivity and control are discouraged from having better protection of medical 
	training equipment. When the medical training equipment is protected against cyber threats and vulnerabilities, the training and teaching of medical students will not be tampered with and will 
	not be cases of incorrect diagnosis and treatment of patients.</p>

<p>My response to Ali's post.
<blockquote><cite>
	<p>Hi Ali,
	<br><br>
	thank you for your thoughts. I absolutely agree with you regarding using a firewall to protect such medical devices. However, I also think, that the firewall is most beneficial as a means of 
	implementing the network segmentation. Whether the medical education is conducted at a medical school or a healthcare institution, in my opinion, there is no need for critical devices to be 
	connected to the main network.</p>
	<p>Since iStan only needs to communicate with the machine which contains the front-end application for setting up the mannequin, the iStan and the machine could reside in their own network 
	segment placed behind a firewall that would allow in or out only certain communications, if any at all (Donovan, 2019).</p>

<blockquote><cite>
	<p>Hi Ags. I think you are correct regarding your conclusions about mitigating the brute force attacks. However, I am not entirely sure if your proposed mitigation against the denial of 
	service would be effective in this case.</p>
	<p>You have suggested that a network firewall could be an effective control for this type of attack. I agree with you that network firewalls can mitigate certain types of denial of 
	service attacks. However in order to perform their packet filtering functions, network firewalls need to be located on a network between a potential attacker and the target (Campbell, 2016). 
	In the case of the iStan mannequin, the denial of service attack was conducted using the MDK3 security testing tool (Glisson, et. al., 2015). The purpose of MDK3 is to test 802.11 wireless 
	networks (Sankar, 2018). Since the attack test took place wirelessly between the attacking system and the access point built into the medical mannequin, I do not see how a network firewall 
	could be employed to mitigate the attack. I may be mistaken on this point, but I would love to hear if you have any further thoughts on using firewalls to mitigate wireless attacks.</p>

	<p>Hi Kevin,
	<br><br>
	thank you for sharing your thoughts. I think you made some good points, since the attack was carried out directly on the devices 802.11 wireless access point (Glisson, et. al., 2015), a firewall would not have helped here. Thank you for pointing this out.</p>
	<p>However, a firewall placed between the mannequin and the machine that controls it (and which, I assume, connects to the main network), could still be helpful. For example, the firewall could 
	be configured to only allow a one way traffic from the machine to the mannequin to permit for the mannequin to be configured (essentially segmenting the mannequin away from the main network) 
	(Liebetrau, 2013). The communication from the mannequin to the machine could then be disallowed to reduce a possibility of a hacker gaining access to the network via a rogue access point.</p>
	<p>Another option is to introduce physical security controls since the wireless access point scanners generally only have a range of up to 45m indoors (Tanaza, 2017). For example, only employees 
	and students with employee/student cards could be permitted entry into buildings with such devices.</p>
