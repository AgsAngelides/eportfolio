<p>The content-centric internet architecture takes the current host-to-host routing and replaces it with the host-to-content methodology (Tyson et al, 2012).</p>
<p>There are many advantages that the content-centric internet infrastructure offers over the existing framework , one of them being the optimisation of the network resources 
by the means of content caching.</p>
<p>The best-known content-centric internet development projects such as Content Aware Searching Retrieval and Stream (COAST) and Named Data Networking (NDN), 
both provide the content caching functionality. The NDN caches its data packets within the Content Store (CS) located on its router whilst the COAST caches 
data contents, query results and chunks of indexes at all infrastructure layers and stores the cached copies within the browser (Ding et al, 2016).</p>
<p>Content caching theoretical simulations indicate that there is a substantial performance gain to be expected for a popular content (Psaras et al, 2011). 
A practical analysis of traffic flowing through BitTorrent () has demonstrated that for smaller size files the number of hops the packet traverses is dramatically reduced 
when the content is cached. The same analysis has found a performance increase when fetching more popular content too (Tyson et al, 2012).</p>
<p>Thus, the improved network performance because of content caching is one of the reasons why the future of the internet lies with the content-centric architecture. </p>
