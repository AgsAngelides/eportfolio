<p>The case study on the Disclosure of Personal Data via a Social Media Application published by the Data Protection Commission (2017) was reviewed in the initial post. The study reviewed an instance 
where an employee who was let go by the company being investigated shared job application cover letters on their social media account without the consent of the applicants and also against the agreement 
outlined within their employment contract. </p>
<p>The Commissioner in charge of this case has found the employer in breach of the GDPR Article 5 (GDPR, 2018).</p>
<p>I agree with my peer responses (Necat, 2022; Ahmad, 2022) discussing the need for storing job application files, such as resumes, in a more secure way. However, I believe, that the suggested data 
encryption or hashing is impractical for many smaller to medium sized businesses who conduct their recruitment in house and irregularly.</p>
<p>Instead, in my opinion, the data security policy which apply to job applicant data should be developed and implemented. The policy should define (Bika, 2022):
	<ul>
		<li>How the candidate data will ‘arrive’ at the company.</li>
		<li>Where the data will be stored.</li>
		<li>The job roles of persons/departments who can access the data.</li>
		<li>How long the files will be kept for.</li>
		<li>The rules on sharing the data via an email.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>Access control and document classification mechanisms could also be employed within the larger organisations or the companies who conduct recruitment more regularly to reduce the number of employees 
having unnecessary access to the personal data.</p>
<p>Encryption together with email forwarding prevention could, however, be used when sharing the potential employee personal data via an email in cases where CVs must be forwarded by person managing the 
recruitment process to the actual hiring manager (Migdal, 2018).</p>
<p>Alternatively, the documents could be converted to pdf format and password protected before being forwarded to the hiring managers within the companies where encryption may not be possible or whilst 
it is being implemented (LaBerge, 2021).</p>
