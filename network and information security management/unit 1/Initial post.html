<h3>Initial post</h3>
<p>The Compromising Medical Mannequin paper (Glisson, 2015) reviews the cyber threats and vulnerabilities faced by the medical training facilities. Namely, the impact a malicious attack could 
have on the education of medical professionals. An incorrectly set up mannequin due to tampering could influence the knowledge of medical students causing incorrect diagnosis and treatment of 
patients down the line.</p>
<p>The vulnerabilities applicable to the iStan medical mannequin, as discussed in this paper, include the TCP network protocol (vulnerable to DOS attacks) and the 802.11 wireless transmission used 
to communicate between the mannequin and the control machines (vulnerable to brute force attacks).</p>
<p>To mitigate the risk of DOS attacks rendering the iStan front-end software Muse unavailable, a network firewall could be used (Kartch, 2016). Such firewalls allow to set up a threshold of a permitted 
number of incomplete TCP requests for a particular destination. When the threshold is exceeded, the requests remain in the queue until the completion or time out (Juniper Networks, 2021).</p>
<p>The vulnerability introduced by the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) used in the 802.11 wireless transmission which allows brute force attacks by malicious actors within the radio range could be eliminated 
by disabling the WPS feature (Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency, 2013). This would make it more difficult for an attacker to gain access to the Wi-Fi network. That said, due to the possible 
medical device limitations, it may not be possible to use the regular password entry method to connect and further investigation may be required.</p>
