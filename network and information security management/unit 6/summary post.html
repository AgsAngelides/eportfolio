<p>In unit 3 we have been asked to perform some basic scans on our assigned websites. I used ping, tracert, nslookup commands on my Windows machine as well 
  as an online IP geolocation lookup tool. The purpose was to examine the route taken by a packet from your local machine to a target IP address 
  (that of the assigned website), analyse the number of hops, average duration taken at each, any delays, lost packets, etc.</p>
<p>During our initial team discussions, we were able to agree on all our basic scan observations, except for one: the geographical location of our assigned 
  website. The latter topic proved trickier to research. It also demonstrated how someone like myself, less experienced in Networking, was quick 
  to accept sometimes inaccurate results produced by an IP address lookup application as a fact.</p>
<p>I see why Andrijana (2022) and Jurbe (2022) in their Peer Responses (and myself initially) have expressed their support to such IP address lookup results: 
  we rely on technology to gives us an answer a lot more often than not. An article published by the think tank Pew Research Centre (Vogels et al, 2020) 
  was looking into this exact issue where various IT pioneers were expressing their concerns over our dependency on the technology and its impact on our 
  critical thinking.</p>
<p>Since the Cyber Security enforcement relies heavily on various tools, such as vulnerability scanners, the results produced have to be trusted to some 
  extent, however, where possible (as in the case of determining the IP address location) alternative checks should be performed to confirm the results, 
  in my opinion.</p>
