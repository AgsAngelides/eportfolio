<p>In the Unit 7 of the module, we have been asked to read a few articles on Kali Linux and then answer a set of questions on each.</p>
<p>The first two articles on Kali Linux (Leroux, 2020; Bhatt, 2018) looked into how to use the security tools suite and the considerations each 
  new user must make before using it. The following three questions were then asked:
  <ol>
    <li>What does the article teach you about carrying out vulnerability scans using Kali?<br>
      <p><i>Both articles highlight the importance of not conducting the scans using your main machine, but rather a virtual machine. This ensures 
        that scans, being risky, do not impact your main machine and do not spill out into your home network.
        <br><br>
        The articles give suggestions on different ways Kali Linux can be used too. For example, you could download a ready to use Debian based Kali Linux 
        and set it up as a virtual machine, or you could create a Debian based virtual machine and install Kali Linux tools on it as you need it.
        <br><br>
        The Leroux (2020) article also advises against installing additional applications on readymade Debian based Kali Linux, since they would most likely 
        come from not authenticated sources.
        <br><br>
        The latter article also reminded the reader that Kali Linux only runs one root user, so the tester must be careful to not corrupt important system 
        files because of those super user privileges assigned by default.
        <br><br>
        The article by Bhatt (2018) provides some examples on how to use the Dmitry and Metasploit tools too.
        </i></p>
    </li>
    <li>What issues might you encounter?<br>
      <p><i>I think the main issue for me would be my lack of knowledge of Linux OS and learning the commands you must use for each security tool. Also, 
        learning to understand what each scan result means.</i>
    </li>
    <li>How would you overcome them?<br>
      <p><i>To be able to use Kali Linux I will have to do a lot of independent research and practicing. I imagine that the more I use the tool, the easier 
        it will become.</i></p>
    </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Then we were asked to read a paper by Bhingardeve & Franklin (2018) which compares pen test tools available and to answer the following 2 questions:
  <ol>
    <li>How do their results compare with your initial evaluation?<br>
      <p><i>In my initial evaluations of Nmap, Metasploit and SQLMap tools, my scores for Metasploit were higher than for Nmap. I felt that Metasploit 
        was easier to use than Nmap. However, in this article, the authors give a higher score to Nmap than Metasploit because they felt that the Nmap 
        was documented and supported better.
        <br><br>
        Both myself and the authors didn’t give a high score to the SQLmap, because just like the authors of this paper, I also thought that the use of
        SQLmmap was limited.
        <br><br>
        However, when we discussed these tools with the team, all three ended up getting the same total score.</i></p>
    </li>
    <li>What do you think of their criteria?<br>
      <p><i>I think the criteria such as Powerful, is very subjective. For example, the SQL map may not be a very versatile tool, but it does a great 
        job at automatic SQL injection testing, and so, when it comes to these types of attacks, should it not be rather flagged as powerful?
        <br><br>
        I also thought that Acclaimed and Popular could have been combined into one criteria instead of two, as to me it’s very similar. However, it 
        appears a tool could Popular but not Acclaimed, and so it is unclear to me how the authors made the judgement on these two criteria.
        <br><br>
        Last criteria, which was also in our list of pen tool assessment criteria, called ‘Easy’ is also debatable, in my opinion. How easy is to use 
        something is very subjective and to someone with no or limited security knowledge, all these tools could be difficult to use.</i></p>
    </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>We were then asked to consider all we have learned so far and the articles/papers we have been asked to read and to answer two more questions:
  <ol>
    <li>What are the pros and cons of using Kali Linux vs. Nessus?<br>
      <p><i>Kali is an open-source free tool whilst Nessus is a paid scanner, however, a basic Nessus version can be obtained free of charge. The 
        free version only provides some basic features, where, Kali provides over 600 security tools, all free of charge.
        <br><br>
        Nessus generates scan reports in a nice format for the user (Said, 2020), where many Kali tools do not do it. Although, you could save your 
        scan results in a file, if needed.
        <br><br>
        Nessus also has a nice graphic user interface which makes is new user friendly.</i></p>
    </li>
    <li>Has this changed your original evaluation score?<br>
      <p><i>Yes, I originally rated Kali Linux down on the ease of use, because, being a Linux based pen testing suite, it creates a learning curve for 
        those with no prior Linux experience. I also scored it down on the ease of installation.
        <br><br>
        Having read the articles now, the tool can be easily installed using the readily available packages and the details on various commands you can 
        run are available online. So, I think, I would give it a higher score in those two areas now.
        <br><br>
        Regarding the Nessus scanner, it has originally received quite high marks from me, and it had the same overall total score as the Kali Linux. I 
        think I would keep the scoring as is for the Nessus which would now be slightly lower than Kali Linux, just because to get most of the tool, you 
        would have to pay for it.</i></p>
    </li>
</ol>
