<p>I have performed various scans on our assigned website loadedwithstuff.co.uk using Kali Linux.</p>

<p>Readily available Kali Linux package powered by Debian (64bit) was used and installed as a VM on a Virtual box. In addition, I used ProtonVpn during 
  all of my scans.</p>

<p>The following scanning tasks were addressed.</p>

<p><b>What OS does the website utilise?</b>
  <br><br>
  I used the OS fingerprinting provided by Nmap to find out the details on the OS and the command nmap -O [IP address].
  <br><br>
  Nmap could not locate one open and one closed port (there were only open ports available at the time of the scan) and so accurate results could 
  not be returned, only the best estimate as below (or aggressive OS guesses, as Nmap calls it):
  <ul>
    <li>Linux 4.15 – 5.6 (89%)</li>
    <li>Linux 5.0 – 5.4 (89%)</li>
    <li>Linux 5.3 – 5.4 (89%)</li>
    <li>Linux 2.6.32 (89%)</li>
    <li>Linux 5.0 (88%)</li>
    <li>Linux 5.0 – 5.3 (88%)</li>
    <li>Linux 5.4 (88%)</li>
    <li>Linux 3.1 (87%)</li>
    <li>Linux 3.2 (87%)</li>
    <li>AXIS 210A or 211 Network Camera (Linux 2.6.17) (87%)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>What web server software is running?</b>
  <br><br>
  For this task I used Kali Linux Nikto package and the command nikto -h [website URL].
  <br><br>
  The results returned said that the web server is running on Apache, however, the server banner has been recently changed from Apache to 
  imunify360-webshield/1.18. It appears the web server uses Webshield to prevent HTTP attacks (Zemskov, 2019).
  <br><br>
  I have also tried whatweb [website URL] command, but I kept getting the error of 'connection reset by peer', which could indicate a firewall closing the connection prematurely (Eadie, 2022).
</p>

<p><b>Is it running a CMS (Wordpress, Drupal, etc.)?</b>
<br><br>
I tried obtaining this information using CMSeeK tool (GeeksForGeeks, 2021) on Kali (had to download it and install it) and no CMS was found.
<br><br>
Then I used whatweb loadedwithstuff.co.uk command and the results had not returned any CMS either.
<br><br>
I did some research, and a2hosting does provide various CMS options, however, our test website has been created using Softaculous scripts which, I assume, 
  did not enable any of the available managers.
</p>

<p><b>What protection does it have (CDN, Proxy, Firewall)?</b>
<br><br>
Wafw00f – is a firewall fingerprinting tool which runs on Python scripts and is part of Kali Linux package (Kali, 2021).
<br><br>
Running the command wafw00f loadedwithstuff.co.uk told me that it uses imunify360 (CloudLinux) Web Application Firewall.
<br><br>
I do not think that the website uses any CDN. I did some research and a2hosting provides CDN through Cloudflare (a2hosting, 2022). However, when I ran 
  the WHOIS command, Cloudflare was not returned in any of the scan results (InfosecMatter, 2020) which implies CND is not used. It appears CDN is 
  not enabled for loadedwithstuff.co.uk.
<br><br>
I also think that the website does not use a proxy. I used the URLextractor tool and the command ./extractor.sh loadedwithstuff.co.uk and the results 
  returned no PAX (Proxy Authentication Configuration) file, which seems to imply a proxy is not used (Son, 2019).
</p>

<p><b>Where is it hosted?</b>
<br><br>
I used the URLextractor tool for this and the command ./extractor.sh loadedwithstuff.co.uk.
<br><br>
The scan confirmed that the web server is hosted in Amsterdam, Netherlands.
</p>

<p><b>Does it have any open ports?</b>
<br><br>
I used Nmap to scan for open ports. I scanned up to 7000 open ports using the command below and the scan returned 7000 tcp open ports. It appears the 
  website has many open ports, and if I had increased my scan range, I probably would have found many more.
<br><br>
Nmap -T4 -v -PN -n -sS –top-ports 7000 –max-parallelism 10 -oA nmapSYN [IP address]
</p>

<p><b>Does the site have any known vulnerabilities?</b>
<br><br>
I used Nikto vulnerability scaner for this and two commands
  <ul>
    <li>nikto -h [website URL]</li>
    <li>nikto -h [website URL] -ssl</li>
</ul>
<br>
The following vulnerabilities were located:
<ul>
  <li>The anti-clickjacking x-frame-options header is not present.</li>
  <li>The x-xss-protection header is not defined.</li>
  <li>The site uses SSL and the STS HTTP header is not defined.</li>
  <li>The site uses SSL and Expect-CT header is not present.</li>
  <li>The X-content-type-options header is not set. This could allow the user agent to render the content of the site in a different fashion 
    to the MIME type.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Interestingly, the scan terminated a few times when the allowed range of errors (20 errors) was exceeded. I have increased the nikto.conf FAILURE value to 
50 and ran the scan again (github, 2018).</p>

<p><b>What versions of software is it using? Are these patched so that they are up to date?</b>
  <br><br>
I could not locate the software version. The only information I was able to find, as per above, tha Apache is used, however, I was unable to locate 
  more information.</p>
