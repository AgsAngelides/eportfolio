<p>For the seminar in Unit 8 we have been asked to read the following articles/documents:
	<ul>
		<li>ICO (2020) Guide to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).</li>
		<li>PCI Security Standards.org (2020) Official PCI Security Standards Council Site - PCI Security Standards Overview. </li>
		<li>HIPAA (2020) HIPAA For Dummies – HIPAA Guide.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>We then had to attempt the following list of questions.</p>
<p><b>Which of the standards discussed in the sources above would apply to the website/ organisation assigned to you for the assessment? For example, a company 
providing services to anyone living in Europe or a European-based company or public body would most likely be subject to GDPR. A company handling online payments would 
most likely need to meet PCI-DSS standards.</b></p>
<p>The General Data Protection (GDPR) would apply to our assigned website loadedwithstuff.co.uk as well as its UK counterpart Data Privacy Act 2018 within which the GDPR is a 
component. This is based on the assumptions that the website targets UK market for customers because of its domain being a UK one. The EU GDPR, specifically Dutch version of it, 
applies too, because the webserver appears to be located in Amsterdam and so the data will be stored and processed within the EU.</p>
<p>In addition to the data protection regulations, PCI DSS SAQ A also applies to our given website. I believe that the full PCI DSS regulations are not applicable, since the website 
appears to have outsourced its payment processing to an external provider, thus only the SAQ A questionnaire should be applicable to loadedwithstuff.co.uk which consist of less requirements (PCI, 2014).</p>
<p><b>Evaluate your assigned website against the appropriate standards and decide how you would check if standards were being met?</b></p>
<p>To confirm it meets the PCI DSS SAQ A requirements you would (Securious, 2022).
	<ul>
		<li>Have to complete an annual self-assessment questionnaire and get it signed by the company’s officer.</li>
		<li>Have to submit the annual AOC (Attestation of compliance).</li>
		<li>Have to conduct quarterly network scans conducted by an Approved Scan Vendor (ASV).</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>To meet the GDPR requirements (including the UK version – DPA), the website must (GDPR, 2018):
	<ul>
		<li>Have a Privacy policy which meets the GDPR/DPA requirements.</li>
		<li>Have a Cookie policy and seek user’s permission for tracking their behaviour via the cookies.</li>
		<li>Store its data securely.</li>
		<li>Be able to resolve all user data requests.</li>
		<li>Be able to secure all systems related to the website’s infrastructure.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p><b>What would your recommendations be to meet those standards?</b></p>
<p>To meet the PCI DSS standard applicable to websites which have outsourced its payments to an external vendor, I would recommended:
	<ul>
		<li>Adding PCI compliance requirements to the business security policy, including intervals at which each compliance activity must be performed and the external payments vendor audits.</li>
		<li>Assigning one responsible person who would have to manage the compliance to these regulations.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>To meet the GDPR requirements I would recommend:
	<ul>
		<li>Either appointing a data officer who would be responsible for managing compliance to this regulation OR outsourcing the initial compliance work to an externa vendor and then 
		assigning day to day compliance oversight (user data requests, right to erasure, right to data correction, etc) role to an existing role within the company.</li>
		<li>Conducting external website provider audits to ensure that the systems and data security standards are met.</li>
		<li>Updating the business security policy to include GDPR requirements, how the company will achieve these.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p><b>What assumptions have you made?</b></p>
<p>The following assumptions have been made:
	<ul>
		<li>The page target audience are UK customers.</li>
		<li>The page has outsourced its payments to an external vendor.</li>
	</ul>
