<p>We have been asked to read chapters 2, 6, 7, 8 of the course text (Pillai, 2017) and Cifuentes & Bierman (2019) and then answer the questions below, adding them as evidence 
to our e-portfolio.</p>
<p><b>What factors determine whether a programming language is secure or not?</b>
<br>
Python, being an open-source language, has a lot of documentation available for it (Pillai, 2017) which means that developers can write an easily readable code. Meanwhile, 
other languages which do not have enough documentation, can result in unreadable code which is difficult to modify and maintain thus increasing the maintenance cost and potentially 
introducing security vulnerabilities each time the code is updated.
<br><br>
Python provides a very rich environment for constructing reusable design and patterns (Pillai, 2017). The Pythonic way of implementing patterns also tends to be very intuitive. 
Other languages such as C++ or Java are mores restrictive with pattern implementations and more less illustrative. The easiness with which the patterns can be implemented, means 
that a code can be built using tested methods which potentially resolve many security issues.</p>
<p><b>Could Python be classed as a secure language? Justify your answer.</b>
<br>
Python could be classed as a secure language if written correctly. However, like any other language, the security of it depends on how it is implemented by the programmer. 
The code can be written poorly, using complex functions, having high coupling, using insecure libraries, etc. Which would make Python in this instances just as unsecure as 
any other language.</p>
<p><b>Python would be a better language to create operating systems than C. Discuss.</b>
<br>
C appears to execute faster. Variables must be declared in C thus ensuring it’s not misinterpreted by the program like in Python. However, Python’s syntax and error debugging 
is easier to understand. Python also uses an automatic garbage collector for memory management where in C this has to be done manually by be programmer. Python also has a larger 
set of built in functions and it is easier to implement data structures (Sidana, 2021).
<br><br>
A paper (Prechelt, 2000) also analysed 6 different programs written in different programming languages and found that Python is a very good alternative to C 
when large amounts of computation and data need to be handled. Also noted that the main advantage of this language is the programmers productivity, since it is a lot easier 
to write and debug.
<br><br>
With all this in mind, I believe that Python could be used to create a better operating system than C.</p>
