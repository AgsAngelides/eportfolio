	<p>Hi Ags. I thought that your diagram was very informative. I do not think that you actually needed the developer agent since they really are not an integral part of the 
	attack, but that seems like a minor point.</p>
	<p>The one area I did have difficulty understanding was the first action of the attacker. For an OS command injection attack to work, the threat agent needs to provide a fully 
	formed, executable command (Portswigger.net, 2022). In your diagram, the attack commences when the attacker "enters /etc/passwd". However, "/etc/passwd" is not an executable 
	command and would just return an error. Instead, the attacker needs to enter a command just as "cat /etc/passwd" to display the contents of the file /etc/passwd.</p>
	<p>Beyond these points, I think your diagram is excellent.</p>

	<p>Hi Kevin,
	<br><br>
	thank you for your post and for the pointer provided. I believe I was potentially unclear in my diagram how the /etc/passwd can be used to obtain the information the hacker 
	is not supposed to have.</p>
	<p>The command does not need to be executable to reveal the files, at least, that is my understanding. If, for example, you have a program that you run on a command line that 
	accepts user's input and that program in the back end uses os.system() Python method, the os.system() method parses the string as shell command and executes it (Kwong, 2014). 
	So whilst the /etc/password is not executable on its own, the incorrectly implemented os.system() method turns it into one. This also applies to web applications which use the 
	same method in their code base.</p>
