<p>Budzak in his paper (2016) states that as high as 90% of information security attacks are a result of human error. Thus, the employee related security risk management is a 
matter of an utmost importance.</p>
<p>A company’s risk management process should consider vulnerabilities introduced not only by a software, network architecture, etc. but also by its staff. The level of risk of a data 
breach or another type of attack occurring because of a user’s mistake is very high, and so one of the risk management objectives should be reducing the likelihood and the impact 
of the human related security vulnerabilities. One such way of reducing the likelihood, is the user Cyber Security training.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of the information security awareness training is harder to quantify, and so the top management often focuses on prioritising the implementation of technical 
defences instead of employee education and training (Mcilwraith, 2021).</p>
<p>The user security training should be part of a new employee onboarding process (for both permanent and temporary staff) as well as an annual companywide event. A paper by Hudock 
et al (2020) shared that many of their study participants reported no security training upon starting a new role as well as having no restrictions on a company’s network upon joining, 
which points to companies underestimating the likelihood of human related security breaches.</p>
<p>To encourage the employee security buy in, the training should consist of not only the company’s security policy review, but it should also include practical skills, 
demonstrations and simulations. As Hight suggest in her paper on the importance of the Cyber Security training (2005), the users are a lot less likely to try and circumvent, 
for example, strong password policies, if it is demonstrated how easily one of the employee passwords could be cracked.</p>
