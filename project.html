		<h3>Introduction to the module</h3>
        <p>The aim of this module is to provide a high level overview of the Cyber Security as a whole. It reviews topics such as:
		<ul>
		<li>Cyber security professions</li>
		<li>Programming concepts and practices</li>
		<li>Ethics behind Cyber Security</li>
		<li>Core Cyber Security subjects like cryptography, ethical hacking, etc.</li>
		<li>Ability to implement security information system</li>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The focus of the 'Unit 1' was all to do with a bigger picture of the Cyber Security industry and the importance of it. It also introduced computer networks, software types, databased, World Wide Web and explained how it all works.
	The Unit focused on teaching discussion skills and laying the foundation for the future units.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>I have not done official studying since by undegraduate studies a few years ago, so it was a little stressful having to jump back into a fast paced course that the MsC in Cyber Security is.</p>
		<p>During the first week, a few main tasks were given: an extensive reading list to complete, an e-portfolio to create and a correctly referenced Initial post to be posted in the Collaborative Discussion Forum.</p>
		<p>Having never done an e-portfolio before or having had much involvement with HMTL, I found the task difficult at the start. Whilst there was guidance was provided by the university, it felt like it was directed at the 
		students with at least a basic knowledge of how e-portfolio design and HTML works. I created an e-portfolio in the end, however, the indicatory duration for this activity as per the student portal did not match the 
		actual time spent in my experience.</p>
		<p>I enjoyed researching and writing a post on the importance of Cyber Security, having chosen mHealth apps as my main discussion topic, however, I found referencing time consuming as I had to familiriase myself 
		with the referencing requirements.In addition, the discussion forum felt a little forced at the beginning; I think a lot of peers haven't had come across this form of assignment before. That said, I thoroughly 
		enjoyed reading others' opinions and sharing mine in the end.</p>
		<p>During this unit a valuable referencing skills were obtained, which will be useful in the future modules. The academic language and discussion skills were also improved which will be needed for later assignments 
		too.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>During the 'Seminar 1: Shell global' we had to look into the Cyber Security professions and think about which one we would like to do.</p>
		<p>Whilst preparing for this discussion topic I have realised that so many Cyber issues stem not from the technical implementation of IT products (many do but not all).
		This is why perhaps I am so interested in working with processes and standards of the Cyber Security rather than with the application of the security tools alone. It is my opinion, 
		that if we have standards in place and provide companies with clear guidance on its implementation, the likeliness of security indicents will be substantially reduced.</p>

		<p>The main task of the 'Unit 3' was to submit the 'Final post' to the Collaborative Discussion Forum on the importness of the Cyber Security.</p>
		<p>I found it a lot easier to formulate my thoughts and conduct research after having to submit an 'Initial post' as well as three individual peer reviews previously. 
		It also took a lot less time to reference my resources used for the post.</p>

		<p>During the 'Unit 5' the work mainly concentrated on the UML diagrams and its applications. A task was given to recreate the UML diagrams seen in the Seminar 2 using the Visual Paradigm tool.</p>
		<p>Whilst some documentation on the UML diagrams was provided in the Unit's reading list, I found it difficult to locate a 'how to' guide on using the Visual Paradigm tool itself. </p>
		<p>The diagrams had to be submitted to the module's tutor for evaluation, and whilst the feedback received was overall good, the Sequence Diagram needed some rework to ensure that life-lines were implemented correctly.</p>

		<p>We have been asked to complete three main tasks in this unit in addition to the weekly reading: submit an 'Initial post' discussing two different security technologies, 
		submit an essay outline due in 'Unit 9' discussing a patient appointment booking web application and complete Linux Command Line Interface introduction.</p>
		<p>I have not used Linux previously, so it was interesting learning new ways of creating working directories, folders and files, manipulating the files and reading it for information. I found it easy 
		to use the Codio learning environment and it helped being able to work at my own pace. I can also see how these skills would be beneficial in working with, for example, log files.</p>
		<p>I also enjoyed writing the essay outline on the web application for booking patients appointments. I was able to apply my skills gained so far in UML diagrams and threat analysis and implement 
		these in the essay. My outline, however, lacked a mention of a known threat analysis method used in the industry as well as the mention of the technologies to be used for the threats to be addressed, as per my tutor's feedback, 
		and I will to ensure this is included in the actual essay. Based on this feedback, I believe, my outline was to broad and not enough detail were contained within it to give a better 
		understand of the overall work to be delivered.</p>
		<p>The third task of the Unit 6, the submission of the Initial post on the subject of two security technologies, was an interesting one to work with. I decided to discuss tools used in combating phishing 
		instead of those we covered in detail in the units like firewalls, so that the discussion forum contains a variety of topics. These tools are also something I have an experience of working with and I have 
		experienced its advantages as well as disatvantages whilst at work.</p>

	<h5><b>Unit overview</b></h5>
	<p>The 'Unit 7' aimed at exploring the concepts of database designs, data management approaches and strategies of secure database management system implementation. It was also the beginning of work on the Python coding skills development.</p>
		
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>In the 'Unit 7' in addition to the reading, I had to respond to at least three peer posts on the security technologies with my own views on it and to beging learning Python coding language.</p>
		<p>As during the Discussion 1, I enjoyed reading my peer responses and I felt like I was able to contribute with some further insights into the technologies my peers chose to discuss. 
		I also found it easier doing the research for responses and referencing once again because of the practice on the previous discussions. I believe these skills will be valuable when 
		writing the Unit 9 essay.</p>
		<p>We also had to begin coding in Python. Whilst I have previously used Python in my undegraduate studies, it has been some time, so I started with the Flode exercises before 
		beginning on Python. I found Flode very intuitive and it helped me with understanding the loops better. I was then able to apply the knowledge from Flode course to Python lessons 
		in Codio and I could definitely see the benefit of starting on Flode first. </p>
