	<button type="button" class="collapsible"><i class="fa fa-angle-double-right" aria-hidden="true" style="padding-right:0.5rem;"></i><b>Seminar #3: Working through an example of a web-based information system</b></button>
	<div class="content">
	<p> For this seminar I chose to review three different threat modelling techniques most commonly used in the banking industry. 
		A short overview as well as advantages/disadvantages are provided provided for each of the models chosen below.<p>
	<p><b> PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) model</b></p>
	<p> This model combines an attacker perspective of a business with risk & impact analysis to create a complete picture of the threats to products 
		and applications. It normally includes 7 stages:
		<ol>
		<li>Business objective definition – what is important to the business.</li>
		<li>Scope definition – what is it you are trying to protect.</li>
		<li>App decomposition – mapping relationship between components such as users, their roles and permissions, assets, data, software, hardware, etc.</li>
		<li>Threat analysis – research threats, build threat repository.</li>
		<li>Vulnerability analysis – mapping weaknesses to threats.</li>
		<li>Attack simulation – using things like attack trees to create a path of how an application can be exploited.</li>
		<li>Risk analysis – revisiting earlier sections and its outcomes.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p> It is a versatile model which is well suited to the banking industry because:
		<ul>
		<li>It is business objective driven model which tries to align it with technical security requirements, and for the banking industry it is very important. 
			In this industry satisfied customers, safe and fast transactions, etc. are very important and this model helps to address each of these. </li>
		<li>Each banking institution has many moving parts and they all need to be secure due to the nature of business. The PASTA model ‘Decomposition’ step 
			ensures that every part of the business and how it all links together is identified.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<br>
	<p><b> STRIDE (combined with Threat Three modelling)</b></p>
	<p> The STRIDE model was originally developed by Microsoft in the late 90s. Each of the letter in the title stands for a different category of threat, hence, 
		this model goal is to identify different types of risks and issues. The six categories are:
		<ol>
		<li>Spoofing</li>
		<li>Tempering with data</li>
		<li>Repudiation</li>
		<li>Information disclosure</li>
		<li>Denial of Service</li>
		<li>Privilege escalation</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>The STRIDE model combined together with Threat Three modelling technique helps to identify in what conditions the threats identified by the STRIDE model can be realized.</p>
	<p>In my opinion, it is one of the better models to be used for threat modelling in the banking industry since it reviews all types of risks and banks are susceptible to every of those types.</p>
	<p>The main disadvantage of this model is the ever-growing threat library. These libraries can grow out of date quite quickly and require a lot of work to be kept up to date.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>LINDDUN (Linkability, Identifiability, Non-Repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of Information, Unawareness, Non-Compliance)</b></p>
	<p> This threat model focuses on privacy and data security. These two topics are a major concern in the banking industry, so this technique can be used when trying to address it.
		The method itself consists of six steps:
		<ol>
		<li>Define DFD – define system’s data flows, data stores, processes and external entities.</li>
		<li>Map privacy threats to DFD.</li>
		<li>Identify threat scenarios.</li>
		<li>Prioritise threats.</li>
		<li>Elicit mitigation strategies</li>
		<li>Select privacy solutions.</li>
		</ol>
	</p>
	<p>LINDDUN model is well suited for banking industry because of its focus on privacy policies. However, just like the STRIDE model, it is time consuming: it requires a lot of 
		time to identify the threats and, since the threats always change, the list of threats identified becomes outdated fast.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<br>
		<p><b><u>Initial forum post: Cyber Security importance in the mHealth apps industry</u></b></p>
		<p>With digital communications replacing voice communications, digital storage making physical storage obsolete, in person shopping being replaced with an online one, smart home networks becoming more and more accessible to all households, the Cyber Security importance has never been more evident for both private and business users.</p>
		<p>The recent shift toward remote working worldwide, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, has further increased the security vulnerabilities of all size businesses. The Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2021 published in March this year has revealed that it is now harder than ever for businesses to ensure Cyber Security compliance (Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, 2021), e.g. up-to-date software and malware protection on their employee laptops, security and user monitoring, etc.</p>
		<p>Remote working is freeing up time that would have otherwise been spent commuting and a large NHS backlog have also resulted in an increase of the usage of exercise and health applications (Quin, 2020). The Digital Health Trends 2021 report (IQVIA, 2021) states that more than 90,000 new health applications were released in 2020. A recent study published by the Macquarie University in Sydney has revealed that 88% of the mHealth applications (a name used for medical, health and fitness apps) were designed with user data harvesting in mind (Tangari et al., 2021). </p>
		<p>The change in lifestyle and the rise of mHealth application usage introduced a new category attractive to Cyber criminals looking to obtain user data. A good example is a recent data breach of a non-password protected GetHealth database which exposed over 61 million user records synced from well-known brand applications such as: Strava, Fitbit, GoogleFit and Apple HealthKit. </p>
		<p>In my opinion, investing in Cyber Security for the business whose primarily service is health and fitness tracking has never been more important. Due to the nature of these applications, the amount of data tracked is considerable and, thus, every breach could have a major impact not only on the user, but also the business. The ICO Trust and Confidence in Data research has found that only one in five UK consumers have trust in companies storing their data (ICO, 2017). With this in mind, a data breach of a major mHealth app such as Strava or GoogleFit could have a significant impact to the user confidence in the product, potentially reducing the business’s user base. This could in turn impact profits, affect employee livelihoods (employee reductions needed to reduce spending) and prevent the business from staying competitive in what’s now becoming an overcrowded market of health and fitness applications.</p>

		<p><b><u>Summary discussion post</u></b><p>
		<p>Activity trackers as well as health and fitness applications are in high demand and widely used, with most of people having first-hand experience using them, my module peers not being an exception.</p>
		<p>Andrijana (2021) has brought an interesting point to attention, i.e. the activity tracker and application data usage in solving criminal cases. There are many more examples of such data being used to prove both someone’s guilt and innocence (Axios, 2019). This calls attention to the data privacy issue as well as the ethics question on whether the data should be easily available to law enforcement. A study results published in 2020 found that the majority of participants from the USA and Germany have never familiarised themselves with the data policies of the activity trackers they were using (Ilhan et al. 2021). Hence, the less computer literate users could not be aware of the extent to which their data is being collected and thus unaware of the impact it could have on their lives if it was accessed by either hackers or other institutions with permission to do so.</p>
		<p>Another issue highlighted by the examples provided by Andrijana (2021) and Kevin (2021) is the sensitivity of health and fitness data. The health data of a person is considered sensitive and it is kept confidential by the health institutions, however the same is not always applied to the health data stored by the health and fitness trackers and applications. Deogun et al. (2019) discusses how certain data on its own may not be considered sensitive. For example, the person’s name stored by the health application is not a security issue, however, that combined with a location and timestamp provides details of one’s whereabouts and should be considered confidential. </p>
		<p>In my opinion, the fitness and health applications and trackers provide many benefits, however, the existing data privacy regulations need updating to provide better security of health and location data being collected. </p>
