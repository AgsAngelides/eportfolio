	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>The focus of the 'Unit 1' was all to do with a bigger picture of the Cyber Security industry and the importance of it. It also introduced computer networks, software types, databased, World Wide Web and explained how it all works.
	The Unit focused on teaching discussion skills and laying the foundation for the future units.</p>

		<p>I have not done official studying since by undegraduate studies a few years ago, so it was a little stressful having to jump back into a fast paced course that the MsC in Cyber Security is.</p>
		<p>During the first week, a few main tasks were given: an extensive reading list to complete, an e-portfolio to create and a correctly referenced Initial post to be posted in the Collaborative Discussion Forum.</p>
		<p>Having never done an e-portfolio before or having had much involvement with HMTL, I found the task difficult at the start. Whilst there was guidance was provided by the university, it felt like it was directed at the 
		students with at least a basic knowledge of how e-portfolio design and HTML works. I created an e-portfolio in the end, however, the indicatory duration for this activity as per the student portal did not match the 
		actual time spent in my experience.</p>
		<p>I enjoyed researching and writing a post on the importance of Cyber Security, having chosen mHealth apps as my main discussion topic, however, I found referencing time consuming as I had to familiriase myself 
		with the referencing requirements.In addition, the discussion forum felt a little forced at the beginning; I think a lot of peers haven't had come across this form of assignment before. That said, I thoroughly 
		enjoyed reading others' opinions and sharing mine in the end.</p>
		<p>During this unit a valuable referencing skills were obtained, which will be useful in the future modules. The academic language and discussion skills were also improved which will be needed for later assignments 
		too.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>During the 'Seminar 1: Shell global' we had to look into the Cyber Security professions and think about which one we would like to do.</p>
		<p>Whilst preparing for this discussion topic I have realised that so many Cyber issues stem not from the technical implementation of IT products (many do but not all).
		This is why perhaps I am so interested in working with processes and standards of the Cyber Security rather than with the application of the security tools alone. It is my opinion, 
		that if we have standards in place and provide companies with clear guidance on its implementation, the likeliness of security indicents will be substantially reduced.</p>

		<p>We have been asked to complete three main tasks in this unit in addition to the weekly reading: submit an 'Initial post' discussing two different security technologies, 
		submit an essay outline due in 'Unit 9' discussing a patient appointment booking web application and complete Linux Command Line Interface introduction.</p>
		<p>I have not used Linux previously, so it was interesting learning new ways of creating working directories, folders and files, manipulating the files and reading it for information. I found it easy 
		to use the Codio learning environment and it helped being able to work at my own pace. I can also see how these skills would be beneficial in working with, for example, log files.</p>
		<p>I also enjoyed writing the essay outline on the web application for booking patients appointments. I was able to apply my skills gained so far in UML diagrams and threat analysis and implement 
		these in the essay. My outline, however, lacked a mention of a known threat analysis method used in the industry as well as the mention of the technologies to be used for the threats to be addressed, as per my tutor's feedback, 
		and I will to ensure this is included in the actual essay. Based on this feedback, I believe, my outline was to broad and not enough detail were contained within it to give a better 
		understand of the overall work to be delivered.</p>
		<p>The third task of the Unit 6, the submission of the Initial post on the subject of two security technologies, was an interesting one to work with. I decided to discuss tools used in combating phishing 
		instead of those we covered in detail in the units like firewalls, so that the discussion forum contains a variety of topics. These tools are also something I have an experience of working with and I have 
		experienced its advantages as well as disatvantages whilst at work.</p>

	<h5><b>Unit overview</b></h5>
	<p>The 'Unit 7' aimed at exploring the concepts of database designs, data management approaches and strategies of secure database management system implementation. It was also the beginning of work on the Python coding skills development.</p>
		
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>In the 'Unit 7' in addition to the reading, I had to respond to at least three peer posts on the security technologies with my own views on it and to beging learning Python coding language.</p>
		<p>As during the Discussion 1, I enjoyed reading my peer responses and I felt like I was able to contribute with some further insights into the technologies my peers chose to discuss. 
		I also found it easier doing the research for responses and referencing once again because of the practice on the previous discussions. I believe these skills will be valuable when 
		writing the Unit 9 essay.</p>
		<p>We also had to begin coding in Python. Whilst I have previously used Python in my undegraduate studies, it has been some time, so I started with the Flode exercises before 
		beginning on Python. I found Flode very intuitive and it helped me with understanding the loops better. I was then able to apply the knowledge from Flode course to Python lessons 
		in Codio and I could definitely see the benefit of starting on Flode first. </p>

		<p>During the Unit 8 we have continued working on our Python skills, had a seminar on Python and SQL integration into security solutions and finalised our discussion on Cyber technologies. </p>
		<p>The continuation from the previous units on Python meant that the skills obtained in the previous weeks were helpful with this unit's new material. I was able to increase my knowledge
		in strings, lists, files and functions and I am hoping this knowledge will help me with our final assignment in Unit 12.</p>
		<p>During the unit 8 we have finalised our discussion on cyber technologies, during which we had to choose and analyse two different types ofcyber security tools available. I chose to address phishing threats
		and the technologies implemented by the business to mitigate it which I have come across during my career. I have gained a deeper understanding I did not possess before of the tools 
		and how they work which I hope will be useful in the further units as well as my day to day work. I also enjoyed reading my peer views on the technologies I selected for this discussion as well as
		the different ones chosen by my peers. It almost felt like a 'crash course' on the variety of tools available and the knowledge gained from it I will be able to implement going forward.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>Since a 2000 word essay on a web-based appointment and scheduling system (ASMIS) was to be handed in during the Unit 9, I found that this is what I spent most of my time on.</p>
		<p>In the said essay we had to consider the ASMIS security requirements, discuss various methods and technologies, their advantages and disatvantages. We have also been asked 
		to use our recently gained knowledge of the UML diagrams and apply it where relevant within the essay.</p>
		<p>After I have planned out the essay's contents, the execution of it was quite easy, however, I found the essay planning stage itself quite challenging. I struggled with my understanding 
		on what the ASMIS system was meant to be in this assignment, i.e. whether it was a subscription based product hosted completely by the provider or a custom product built upon request to be 
		hosted and maintained by the Clinic going forward. My problem solving approach would have been very different based on which type of ASMIS it was. I have received the clarification from the 
		tutor when requested, however, I feel like a little more guidance on the assingment page would have saved me a lot of time.</p>
		</p>Overall, I have enjoyed applying the knowledge gained during this module in producing the essay. I have also found the tutor's feedback given on on my essay outline in the earlier weeks 
		extremelly useful when trying to stay focused on what must be discussed.</p>

	<p>The Unit 11 was focused on a secure web design. We studied HTML, CSS and Javascript in Codio and did some more reading on the same topics. Django framework was also touched 
	upon as part of the preparation for the seminar in week 11. During this week we had to start thinking about our programming task due in week 12. The goal of this programming

		<p>In week 10 we had to complete a lecturecast on a secure web development topic, complete Codio lessons on HTML, CSS and Javascript as well as submit a programming outline
		for the activity due on week 12 of this module.</p>
		<p>I have enjoyed the lecturecast and found it very informative. My day to day work is on web applications, and I never previously looked up what actually makes up a web-application. 
		After completing this lecturecast I feel that I know more about the subject which is going to help me in my current role as well as going forward.</p>
		<p>I enjoyed working through Codio HTML, CSC and Javascript lessons. I do, however, think these would have been more beneficial at the very start of the course rather than towards the end. 
		On the first week we were asked to create an academic ePortfolio, and I think unless you knew how to use HTML and CSS from before, the process of creating one can be very confusing 
		and time consuming.</p>
		<p>A programming outline also had to be submit in week 10. The outline had to detail the code we had to prepare for our assignment due in week 12. The assignment is to write a program 
		using Python which implements one of the security methods we discussed within our essays in week 9. I have chosen to do a program which allows the user to login and register with the 
		help of the terminal. User details are stored in a local csv file. The program will do various password checks to ensure only strong passwords are used, it will encrypt suitable passwords 
		and lock accounts after too many failed login attempts.<br>
		I think the aim of the outline is to help us to plan out our code in a logical and well structured way and to help us to find any gaps in the logic. I definitely think that it was worth 
		writing an outline for these reasons and it was a lot easier to begin working on the actual code once I had a plan in place.</p>
