<p> For this seminar I chose to review three different threat modelling techniques most commonly used in the banking industry. 
		A short overview as well as advantages/disadvantages are provided provided for each of the models chosen below.</p>
		
<p><b> PASTA (Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis) model</b></p>

<p> This model combines an attacker perspective of a business with risk & impact analysis to create a complete picture of the threats to products 
		and applications. It normally includes 7 stages:
	<ol>
	<li>Business objective definition – what is important to the business.</li>
	<li>Scope definition – what is it you are trying to protect.</li>
	<li>App decomposition – mapping relationship between components such as users, their roles and permissions, assets, data, software, hardware, etc.</li>
	<li>Threat analysis – research threats, build threat repository.</li>
	<li>Vulnerability analysis – mapping weaknesses to threats.</li>
	<li>Attack simulation – using things like attack trees to create a path of how an application can be exploited.</li>
	<li>Risk analysis – revisiting earlier sections and its outcomes.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p> It is a versatile model which is well suited to the banking industry because:
	<ul>
	<li>It is business objective driven model which tries to align it with technical security requirements, and for the banking industry it is very important. In this industry 
	satisfied customers, safe and fast transactions, etc. are very important and this model helps to address each of these. </li>
	<li>Each banking institution has many moving parts and they all need to be secure due to the nature of business. The PASTA model ‘Decomposition’ step ensures that every 
	part of the business and how it all links together is identified.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
	
<br>

<p><b> STRIDE (combined with Threat Three modelling)</b></p>
<p> The STRIDE model was originally developed by Microsoft in the late 90s. Each of the letter in the title stands for a different category of threat, hence, 
	this model goal is to identify different types of risks and issues. The six categories are:
	<ol>
	<li>Spoofing</li>
	<li>Tempering with data</li>
	<li>Repudiation</li>
	<li>Information disclosure</li>
	<li>Denial of Service</li>
	<li>Privilege escalation</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>The STRIDE model combined together with Threat Three modelling technique helps to identify in what conditions the threats identified by the STRIDE model can be realized.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it is one of the better models to be used for threat modelling in the banking industry since it reviews all types of risks and banks are susceptible to every of 
those types.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of this model is the ever-growing threat library. These libraries can grow out of date quite quickly and require a lot of work to be kept up to date.</p>

<br>

<p><b>LINDDUN (Linkability, Identifiability, Non-Repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure of Information, Unawareness, Non-Compliance)</b></p>
<p> This threat model focuses on privacy and data security. These two topics are a major concern in the banking industry, so this technique can be used when trying to address it.
	The method itself consists of six steps:
	<ol>
	<li>Define DFD – define system’s data flows, data stores, processes and external entities.</li>
	<li>Map privacy threats to DFD.</li>
	<li>Identify threat scenarios.</li>
	<li>Prioritise threats.</li>
	<li>Elicit mitigation strategies</li>
	<li>Select privacy solutions.</li>
	</ol>
</p>
<p>LINDDUN model is well suited for banking industry because of its focus on privacy policies. However, just like the STRIDE model, it is time consuming: it requires a lot of 
time to identify the threats and, since the threats always change, the list of threats identified becomes outdated fast.</p>
