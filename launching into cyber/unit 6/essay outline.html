<h5>Essay outline</h5>
<p>Introduction
 <ul>
<li>Discuss the move towards task automation in various industries, touching upon the health care industry.</li>
<li>Introduce the essay business problem and its expected outcome.</li>
<li>Visualise the current booking process and the desired booking process with ASMIS implemented with the help of the UML sequence diagrams.</li>
<li>Discuss why the UML sequence diagrams are useful for visualising interactions.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Introduce ASMIS:
<ul>
  <li>Discuss what ASMIS is and what it does.</li>
<li>Describe ASMIS using the UML Object diagram to demonstrate its attributes and functions. This will help to establish the systems’ components too, required later 
  for threat analysis.</li>
<li>Discuss why the Object oriented diagram was used and the benefits of it.</li>
<li>Discuss the benefits of using the ASMIS and compare it to the manual booking process.</li>
<li>Mention the ‘CIA triangle model’ of a good application and how it is applicable to ASMIS.</li>
</ul>
</p>

</p>
ASMIS related threats:
<ul>
  <li>Visualise threats posed by using ASMIS with the help of the UML use case diagram.</li>
<li>Explain why this diagram was chosen for threat visualisation.</li>
<li>Discuss each threat in more detail.</li>
<li>Give examples of where similar systems were exposed to Cyber threats in recent history, reference it.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Addressing cyber threats:
<ul>
<li>Discuss how cyber threats posed by human factor can be addressed (access control, training, etc.) Give real life examples, refence it.</li>
<li>Discuss the network security requirements.</li>
<li>Discuss monitoring tools used to track the attacks that already happened.</li>
<li>Assuming the system is being acquired from a Supplier, discuss the procurement process that should be used to acquire a product that will connect to the clinic’s 
  network, to ensure there is no cyber threat posed by the external supplier (since software threats cannot be addressed as it is a non-customisable system 
  sold as is).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Discuss law:
<ul>
<li>Since to be able to process bookings, the new system will gather personal data (name, surname, contact details, address, DOB), the GDP implications must be addressed.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Summary:
<ul>
<li>Provide an overview of the positives of automation such as ASMIS.</li>
<li>Provide an overview of how the automation can be made safe with respect to Cyber Security despite all the threats discussed above.</li>
<li>Give examples of where similar systems have been successfully implemented and are still working well.</li>
</ul>
</p>
