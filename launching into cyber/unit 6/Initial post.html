<p>Bruce Schneier (2000: 149) once famously said ‘People often represent the weakest link in the security chain and are chronically responsible for the failure 
  of security systems’. Many companies seem to share this belief and thus security technologies such as Proofpoint Essentials URL Defense and Microsoft 365 
  Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) are commonly used to protect internal systems from one of the most widely spread cyber threats – targeted phishing emails.</p>

<p>The Proofpoint URL Defense scans the incoming emails for URLs. If any are found, it gets rewritten and redirected to an email filter where it receives a risk 
  ranking. If the URL is deemed unsafe, the user will be notified upon clicking on the link with “the website is blocked” message (2019).</p>

<p>URL scanning security tools can be of great help in a world where the quality of phishing emails is constantly improving. The users cannot always tell whether 
  the email is real or not, or they are not aware of methods that can be used to tell if the link is unsafe, for example, hovering over the link to see the actual 
  address. Hence, such tools can be used in addition to the user Cyber Security training enforced by companies who want to reduce the human factor of Cyber Security 
  even further.</p>

<p>However, there is downside to the tools like this too. First of all, it can provide a false sense of security. Whilst the manufactures are aware of their URL 
  rewriting and blocking not always being 100% accurate (2021), the companies purchasing these products, as well as the users, may not be as well informed. 
  The report published by the HM Government (2018) flags up the perception gap between the actual threat of the Cyber Crime and how the society perceives it. 
  This perception gap indicates that people often overestimate the protection provided by the security tools thus, in this case, reducing the time they spend 
  investigating the emails.</p>

<p>There are more drawback of such tools too. URLs coming from external suppliers or other professional bodies may be incorrectly flagged as spam and not delivered 
  or the URLs may be rewritten to exclude the URL parameters thus making the links unusable even if deemed safe. The emails with rewritten URLs also tend to be less 
  user friendly (Samuel A. Rebelsky, 2016; cellProfiler, 2015).</p>

<p>Another tool, as mentioned above, is becoming more commonly used to reduce threats posed by phishing emails: Office 365 ATP. Since there are over a million 
  companies worldwide using the Office 365 products (Statista, 2021), having a readily available cloud-based email filtering service available as an add-on is 
  extremely attractive to many businesses.</p>

<p>The ATP is part of the existing Exchange Online Protection (EOP) security system already in place for Office 365 products. The ATP scans emails for malicious 
  links and attachments and quarantines those it determines to pose a threat. It also has additional anti-phishing and anti-spoofing checks which use machine 
  learning technologies to decide if the anti-phishing/anti-spoofing policy must be applied and what response must be used based on the configuration provided 
  by the local admin users. Those interested in security data analysis are also provided with various real-time reports and widgets whilst the security teams can 
  also use the provided Attack simulator to find vulnerable users within the system and potentially educate them (Van Surksum, 2020).</p>

<p>As with all security tools, there are limitations too. The main one, Microsoft office 365 being a very popular and complex product, due to the number of packages 
  if offers, means there are many vulnerabilities to be exploited by the hackers (Security Boulevard, 2021). Others, specific to the ATP vulnerabilities such as 
  phishing from internal Office 365 users, are also of concern (Heinemeyer, 2020).</p>

<p>To sum up, in my opinion, security tools used by businesses to reduce the impact of phishing threats is a great way forward, however, the security feature 
  implementation shouldn’t stop there. User education should be applied in parallel to any new tools being implemented and the tool limitations should be considered 
  and discussed to ensure everyone’s vigilance.</p>
