<h5><u>Initial post:</u>Cyber Security importance in the mHealth apps industry</h5>

<p>With digital communications replacing voice communications, digital storage making physical storage obsolete, in person shopping being replaced with an online one, 
smart home networks becoming more and more accessible to all households, the Cyber Security importance has never been more evident for both private and business users.</p>

<p>The recent shift toward remote working worldwide, in response to the Covid-19 pandemic, has further increased the security vulnerabilities of all size businesses. 
The Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2021 published in March this year has revealed that it is now harder than ever for businesses to ensure Cyber Security compliance 
(Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport, 2021), e.g. up-to-date software and malware protection on their employee laptops, security and user monitoring, etc.</p>

<p>Remote working is freeing up time that would have otherwise been spent commuting and a large NHS backlog have also resulted in an increase of the usage of exercise and 
health applications (Quin, 2020). The Digital Health Trends 2021 report (IQVIA, 2021) states that more than 90,000 new health applications were released in 2020. 
A recent study published by the Macquarie University in Sydney has revealed that 88% of the mHealth applications (a name used for medical, health and fitness apps) 
were designed with user data harvesting in mind (Tangari et al., 2021).</p>

<p>The change in lifestyle and the rise of mHealth application usage introduced a new category attractive to Cyber criminals looking to obtain user data. A good example is a 
recent data breach of a non-password protected GetHealth database which exposed over 61 million user records synced from well-known brand applications such as: Strava, Fitbit, 
GoogleFit and Apple HealthKit.</p>

<p>In my opinion, investing in Cyber Security for the business whose primarily service is health and fitness tracking has never been more important. Due to the nature of these 
applications, the amount of data tracked is considerable and, thus, every breach could have a major impact not only on the user, but also the business. The ICO Trust and Confidence 
in Data research has found that only one in five UK consumers have trust in companies storing their data (ICO, 2017). With this in mind, a data breach of a major mHealth app such 
as Strava or GoogleFit could have a significant impact to the user confidence in the product, potentially reducing the business’s user base. This could in turn impact profits, 
affect employee livelihoods (employee reductions needed to reduce spending) and prevent the business from staying competitive in what’s now becoming an overcrowded market of 
health and fitness applications.</p>
