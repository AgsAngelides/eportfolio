<p>This week’s seminar is about programming, SQL and programming paradigms </p>

<p>We have been asked to research programming paradigms and compare it to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).</p>

<p>The two paradigms I chose are: Functional programming and Procedural programming.</p>

<h5>Functional programming</h5>

<p>The Functional programming focuses on, as the title suggests, functions and the combinations of it. It builds software by composing pure functions (no side effects, e.g. 
printing to the screen) and avoids shared state (variables accessed by more than one function), mutability (changing object’s state after it has been declared) (Elliott, 2017). 
It is also based on the declarative programming model (the code is written to describe what you want it to do and not how you want it to be done; the compiler 
figures that part out), whereas, the OOP programming uses the imperative mode (it describes how to accomplish the goal by describing the steps that update the state of the 
computer) (Computer Hope, 2019). </p>

<p>Functional programming advantages over OOP (Felsen, 2017):
<ul>
<li>It can be easier to test functions than objects within classes as you only need to provide input and confirm the result is as expected. In an OOP, however, if an object 
contains many attributes and procedures, you will need to provide a lot of data to get starter and test every single method and variations of it.</li>
<li>Functional programming uses pure functions (independent), which means it’s easy to move them around within the code as well as to reuse them in other applications. 
Functions in OOP, however, rely on the class, so you cannot move them to another class and re-use without doing extra checks and adjustments.</li>
<li>Using immutable variables is safer in multi-threaded applications.</li>
<li>It allows to trace through all User Interface (UI) states since for each new state a new object must be created.</li>
<li>Pure functions and its combinations run faster than classes with various objects that contain data.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>OOP advantages over Functional programming:
<ul>
<li>Because OOP uses inheritance-based approach, you don’t need to specify each object’s attributes and methods. You can reuse those available from the class and then only 
specify any additional ones required. This saves time on large projects and provides good scalability.</li>
<li>It’s great for security reasons because all variables are enclosed inside the class, thus hiding it from the outside.</li>
<li>Due to the class-object design structure, it’s easy to transition customer requirements to the code and make it work exactly how the customer requires it to work. 
Where functional programming is counter intuitive, and it requires learning how to convert real life scenarios to just data manipulations.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Functional vs OOP summary:
<br><br>
Functional programming is best suited for projects where all objects are known but the behaviors could change, where OOP seems to be better suited in instances where the behavior 
is known but the data could change.
<br><br>
Since most of the time we want to be able to evolve the data we start with at the beginning of the project and since the OOP way of programming is easier to understand, the 
OOP is a more popular option of the two.</p>

<h5>Procedural programming</h5>

<p>In the Procedural programming the code is split into blocks called procedures where each focusses on carrying out a specific task. These code blocks (procedures) contain 
computational steps in order specified by the programmer. The procedures are also sometimes referred to as routines, subroutines, and functions.</p>

<p>This type of programming paradigm is implemented by considering the large problem first. This is then split into smaller subproblems until each of them is a discrete 
task which can be solved by a specific code block, a procedure (Isaac Computer Science, 2021).</p>

<p>Procedural programming advantages over OOP (Khawaja, 2021):
<ul>
<li>Procedures can reuse the same global variables.</li>
<li>Procedures can be called many times, reducing the code size, and saving time.</li>
<li>Easier to test and debug: it’s much simpler testing each individual procedure and reading a small block of code.</li>
<li>Because of its reusability, less memory is required.</li>
<li>There are many procedures already available online, making it easy to learn.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>OOP advantages over Procedural programming:
</ul>
<li>Since data and methods are stored within an object inside a class, there is extra security provided, where in Procedural programming methods and data are separate items. 
The procedural programming also focuses on operations, not data, like OOP, which can be troublesome if working with sensitive information.</li>
<li>It is easier to know what method is responsible for changing a variable when debugging in the OOP code, where in Procedural programming, global variables can be accessed 
and manipulated by any procedure making it hard to find out where the issue lies.</li>
<li>It is easier to transfer new application requirements to object-oriented code than to procedures.</li>
<li>Through inheritance OOP is reusable where procedures in the Procedural code cannot be reused.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Procedural vs OOP summary:
<br><br>
Whilst Procedural programming may be more efficient to run and test, the OOP offers the data security and a more intuitive way of converting real world requirements to code.</p>
