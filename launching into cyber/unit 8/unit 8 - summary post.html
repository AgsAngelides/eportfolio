<p>Most recent statistics on phishing are alarming. Verizon report (2021) confirmed phishing remains the most popular type of cyber-attack which has been present in 36% of 
all breaches in 2021 (an increase from 25% in the previous year). Phishing has also cost $4.65 million in 2021 (IBM, 2021) only to be overtaken by the Business 
Email Compromise (BEC). Phishing has also been recognized as the main ransomware attack vector by the researchers at the security company Coveware (2021).</p>

<p>Two security technologies which mitigate the risk posed by phishing were discussed: the Proofpoint URL Defense and Office 365 ATP. Both tools attempt to protect the user 
by analysing the links in the emails. The Proofpoint URL Defense re-writes URLs in the emails to be redirected through Proofpointâ€™s filter when clicked; if the link is deemed 
safe, the user is allowed to access the webpage (2021). The Office 365 ATP provides phishing protection too, however, it has many other security features and allows more 
customisation. For example, admins can configure ATP responses to phishing and spoofing instead of applying standard ones, such as, email quarantine (Van Surksum, 2020).</p>

<p>These technologies, however, may provide less security than the users think. As Kevin (2022) pointed out, phishing can now use QR codes against which existing technologies are 
obsolete. This brings out a question, whether placing all types of phishing under one category is an outdated way of addressing this threat. There are now 11 types of phishing 
recognised (panda security, 2021) and, perhaps, addressing each type as its own threat would provide a more bullet proof phishing defence. </p>

<p>Combining the implementation of such tools with raising the user awareness is important too. Training which involves cyber exercises is suggested by the NCSC (2020) and it 
could involve Phishing Attack Simulations provided by the Office 365 ATP (Van Surksum, 2020). Whilst I agree with Elizabeth (2022) that such simulations may not on its own 
protect the business, it will, however, put threats into perspective and allow the user to visualise consequences of their actions, in my opinion.</p>
