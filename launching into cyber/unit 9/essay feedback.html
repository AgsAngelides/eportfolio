<p>Thank you for submitting your individual essay for the Launching into Cyber Security Module</p>

<p>In this essay, you were asked to produce a report to management of Queens Medical Centre on a web-based appointment and scheduling management information system (ASMIS), providing the following information:
<ul>
<li>Details of the benefits of the ASMIS as well as the potential problems including potential cyber threats to the system.</li>
<li>The report must include at least two UML diagrams. Each diagram should show aspects of the system and a threat modelling technique that can be used to identify 
and mitigate potential cyber threats.</li>
<li>A background to the UML diagrams and modelling techniques, along with justifications for their use with supporting references.</li>
<li>The Cyber Security technologies that can be used to address the problem, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of the solutions with references to examples in which the 
technology has been employed.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Overall, excellent work done. To improve your grades further, do take note of the developmental areas highlighted below.</p>
<h4>Knowledge and understanding</h4>
<p>You discuss potential benefits of ASMIS.  You employed a combination of Abuse case, sequence diagrams and STRIDE modelling techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities 
and their impact. You thoroughly discuss a number of measures and technologies to address the identified and these include: 2FA,   firewall, TLS/SSL  and encryption</p>
<p>While the ULM diagrams employed look good and elegant, it would have been great to employ class diagram to illustrate how data will be generated and stored within the ASMIS 
system on top of the other useful diagrams provided  - to provide the software view as well.</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Criticality</h4>
<p>You demonstrate criticality in your discussion and appraisal of the proposed solution providing counter solutions to limitations identified, which is excellent. 
However, it is unclear how the repudiation and elevation of  privilege threat within the system will be addressed â€“ ie how do we ensure a non-clinical staff is 
unable to view clinical report?</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Use of relevant sources</h4>
<p>Relevant sources have been provided to support discussion which is excellent.</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Structure and presentation</h4>
<p>The report is well written and very easy to read. While it was a delight to read, the report would benefit from organising the proposed measures around the STRIDE to make it 
easier to follow.  Perhaps a summary table showing how each threat and the corresponding security measure would help the reader.</p>
<br><br>
<h4>Academic integrity</h4>
<p>While some references have been provided to support discussion on security measures which is good, it is advisable to avoid personal blogs as much as possible to improve the 
quality and integrity of the report.</p>
