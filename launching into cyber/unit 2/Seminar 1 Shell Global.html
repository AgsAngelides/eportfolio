<p>The aim of the <u>Seminar 1: Shell global</u> was to conduct a case study on an international company 'Shell Global' and to discuss any security concerns this company has had or may have, 
provide examples of the dealings with such concerns and compare it to other international businesses. The difficulties that the Cyber professionals may deal with at such large companies 
as well as smaller businesses were also part of the discussion.</p>

<p>Whilst conducting my research I have come across information about a recent 2021 security breach (Shell, 2021) which occured on Accellionâ€™s File Transfer Appliance (FTA) used by Shell Global.</p>

<p>It seemed to me as if Shell tried to deflect their responsibility by placing an accent on the 'Third party software' on every of their public announcements, however, in my opinion, there were many factors that contributed to this security breach:
<ul>
<li>Cyber Security practices are yet to become part of the procurement and supply chain processes. When procuring third party applications which connect to a companies network and gather sensitive data, it is 
extremely important to ensure that the supplier Cyber Vulnerabilities will not impact your business (Green, 2017).</li>
<li>Patching did not occur on time. The vulnerability to the FTA was discovered a few months prior to the security breach. Had the FTA been patched on time, the security incident could have been avoided (Montalbano, 2021).</li>
<li>The Accellion FTA software uses an old Lynux CENTOOS 6 for which support stopped in November 2020. Shell could have transitioned to using a more robust new platform Kiteworks offered by the same supplier. However, transitioning
to the new software can have a wide reaching impact to the rest of the business, so the transition never happened (Matthews, 2021). </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>To sum up, by conducting a supplier due diligence and patching the IT systems, including Lynux ones, when needed, could have potentially avoided this incident.</p>
