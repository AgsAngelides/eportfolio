<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Acme Manufacturing has decided to purchase an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system and is considering three options:
  <ul>
    <li>A commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solution.</li>
    <li>An open-source (OS) solution.</li>
    <li>An in-house developed solution.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Company Profile and Risk Appetite</h3>
<p>Acme Manufacturing is a small-to-medium sized enterprise (SME), employing 150 staff. They currently use spreadsheets to track and manage resource 
  planning and scheduling. Based upon research into similar organisations, this report makes the following assumptions:
  <ul>
    <li>The company has a small IT team where every person performs multiple tasks (Malhotra & Temponi, 2010).</li>
    <li>The company has a flat hierarchy, enabling faster decisions (Poba-nzaou & Raymondl, 2010).</li>
    <li>Acme Manufacturing is profitable; annual turnover up to £25m (Clark, 2022).</li>
    <li>The company prioritises steady over aggressive growth (Yap & Ng, 2015).</li>
    <li>The company is privately owned, based on the SME UK statistics (Office for National Statistics, 2018).</li>
    <li>The company uses a functional organizational structure; the tasks are divided into functional units where each unit handles one aspect of the 
      product/service (Kovaci et al, 2021).</li>
</ul>
Based upon this profile, according to the UK SMEs Survey by Studio Graphene (Jones, 2021) Acme Manufacturing is likely risk averse and possesses a low-risk 
appetite.
</p>
<h3>Business risks</h3>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Lack of employee buy-in can negatively impact ERP implementation time, effort, and cost (Malhotra & Temponi, 2010).</li>
  <li>Poorly implemented ERP systems may not provide return on investment and impact performance (Quiescenti, 2006; Summer, 2000).</li>
  <li>SMEs are less likely to survive/overcome a failed ERP implementation (Muscatello et al., 2003).</li>
</ul>

    <th>Applicable risks</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>COTS Solution</td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>R1 - Due to inflexibility, the COTS solution may not support all business requirements (Malhotra & Temponi, 2010).</li>
        <li>R2 - New versions can incur additional implementation costs (Babey, 2006).</li>
        <li>R3 - COTS tend to require a high level of costly customisation (Babey, 2006; Quiescenti, 2006).</li>
        <li>R4 - Total costs of a COTS solution often reduce annual profits (Holland & Skarke, 2001).</li>
        <li>R5 - Increases reliance on a single vendor and inherits any vendor security issues (Tasnawijitwong & Samanchuen, 2018).</li>
        <li>R6 - 66% to 70% of ERP implementations fail (Poba‐Nzaou et al, 2008) leading to significant financial loss if COTS solution is used.</li>
        <li>R7 - Many known COTS providers do not support the DR requirements (QuickBooks, 2011; OracleNetsuite, 2022).</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Open-source solution</td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>R1 - No vendor support available (Olson et al, 2018).</li>
        <li>R2 - Lack of documentation, compliance with industrial standards, liability responsibility (Olson et al, 2018).</li>
        <li>R3 - High level of customisation, if implemented, can introduce security vulnerabilities (Ashraf, 2019).</li>
        <li>R4 - Open-source libraries often introduce security vulnerabilities (Veracode, 2021).</li>
        <li>R5 - Open-source ERP could have higher IT costs (Economides & Katsamakas, 2006, as cited in Johansson & Sudzina, 2008 ).</li>
      </ul>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In-house solution</td>
    <td>
      <ul>
        <li>R1 - Inexperienced personnel can take a long time to implement an in-house ERP solution (Malhotra & Temponi, 2010).</li>
        <li>R2 - Potential security risks as the developer is inexperienced (Amroussi, 2022).</li>
        <li>R3 - The system may become unmanageable if the developer leaves the organisation (Shahzad et. al., 2017).</li>
      </ul>
