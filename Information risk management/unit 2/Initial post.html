<p>In the paper by Spears & Barki (2010) the authors conduct both Qualitative and Quantitative assessments to confirm or otherwise disprove that the user participation does have a 
positive impact to the Security Risk Management (SRM) process.</p>
<p>The Qualitative research method was applied by conducting interviews with one sample of professionals and then conducting a survey study with another sample who had some prior 
compliance knowledge. The information gathered provided knowledge on activities and behaviours concerned with the user involvement in the SRM process and allowed for a construction 
of a process model by applying the three user participation theories: buy-in, emergent interactions and system quality.</p>
<p>The Quantitative methods allowed the authors to test the theoretical model produced in the Qualitative method research phase. Thus, the combination of the Quantitative and 
Qualitative methods produced rich context and the testability of the study.</p>
<p>In the paper the authors discussed a variety of benefits arising from the user participation in the SRM process, however, all of these fell under one of the three theories:
	<ul>
		<li>Emergent Interactions theory. The authors have confirmed that the users may be more likely to adhere to SRM controls if they have been involved in its process and 
		built personal relationships with the Information Security professionals.</li>
		<li>Buy-in theory: users involved in the SRM process find it more personally important and relevant, thus decreasing the risk of users not following the processes.</li>
		<li>System Quality theory: the users contribute to the better quality of the Security Risk Management processes and controls by providing the needed information.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>The paper highlighted the importance of having the users to work with when conducting the security assessments and defining the SRM policy, which is certainly going to be a 
disadvantage for us when conducting assessments for our assignments, due to the lack of access to the users. Our assessments will have to rely on the assumptions on how the 
business operates, which may introduce additional risks and hide others. </p>
<p>Because of this lack of access, we will not be able to apply the Qualitative research methods and will have to rely on the Quantitative data analysis of pre-existing data of 
risk assessments performed on similar applications and companies.</p>
<p>However, a potential of producing a risk assessment based on irrelevant to the business assumptions could be reduced by us researching, synthesizing and looking for patterns in 
large set of existing data. This would ensure our speculations on how the business runs are more relevant thus making our risk assessment more useful.</p>
