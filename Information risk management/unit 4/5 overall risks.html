<p>The papers by  Read Roy et al (2015) and Hijazi et al (2014) have both discussed very different risk categories and reviewed even more different categories from other related 
research.</p>
<p>After a lot of consideration, I believe the following 4 categories are the overall causes of risks:
	<ol>
		<li>Technical – this could be due to incorrect theoretical knowledge implementation, incorrect architecture, inexperienced developers, continuous changing requirements, etc.</li>
		<li>Business/Organisational – risks introduced by the organizational environment the new software is to be deployed at. For example, the design of software no longer matches 
		the business process, lack of buy-in interest from managerial stuff, employees, etc.</li>
		<li>External – these are risks caused by things such as earthquakes, load-shedding, regulatory changes, inflation, etc.</li>
		<li>Project management – these are risks related to the management of the new software development and implementation, such as insufficient documentation, lack of 
		communication, lack of user involvement when clarifying the requirements, etc.</li>
	</ol>
<p>
<p>I could not come up with a 5th overall risk, since I felt that a lot of the other risks discussed by the two papers fell into one of 4 above categories.</p>
