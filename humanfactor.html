	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>This unit aims to explore the human behaviour and its implications when designing the computing systems with respect to cyber security, discuss the human limitations and 
	capabilities and their impact on usable security, discuss the concept of insider threat.</p>
	
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Blog post - lay summary on the paper on the user behaviour on smartphones</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>Over the years, the smartphone popularity has only been growing. These devices now store large quantities of sensitive user data such as location information, 
		contacts, etc. and so it is important to protect it. To be able to secure the data, it is necessary to understand the smartphone user behaviour so that effective user 
		policies and training can be developed.</p>
		<p>The security issues in the smartphones can be introduced, among others, by insecure or unfriendly (malicious) applications installed by the user, the loss or theft of 
		the device, connections to insecure WIFIs, etc. There are many tools available to the user to help with these risks: mobile antivirus, backup tools, passwords, etc. 
		However, these tools may not be enough to protect the sensitive data if the actual user behaviour is unknown.</p>
		<p>To obtain more information on the smartphone user behaviour, an online survey was created and conducted on the users in China in 2016. Its aim was to find out more about 
		the user attitudes and actions towards the smartphone security and compare it against the demographic user data (user age, sex, occupancy, etc.).</p>
		<p>The 338 survey participants included both women and men, those with higher education as well as those working for private and public organisations.</p>
		<p>The survey analysed three aspects: the user behaviour related to security on their smartphones, the user behaviour when implementing security add-ons (passwords, 
		antivirus, etc) and the data backup related user actions.</p>
		<p>The survey had found that:
			<ul>
				<li>Less than 20% of users analyse the permissions needed by the application before installing it.</li>
				<li>More than 40% of users do not download applications from secure sources.</li>
				<li>Only 21% of users always log out of applications after using it.</li>
				<li>Over 40% of participants have clicked on links in emails prior to investigating it.</li>
				<li>Only 46% of users check for smartphone software updates.</li>
				<li>Most users connect to unsecure wifi occasionally.</li>
				<li>Backups are never or occasionally used by three quarters of the participants.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>The same survey has also shown that users are likely to install security related software on their smartphones such as antivirus, use screen locks and passwords and turn off their location services. However, over 40% of participant passwords were weak.</p>
		<p>The information provided by the users was then compared to the demographic user data (sex, age, etc).
			<ul>
				<li>Male smartphone are more likely to install risky application, however, they are also better of cleaning personal information from old devices and logging out of applications.</li>
				<li>Students are better at keeping their devices updated than those employed.</li>
				<li>Employed participants change their mobile devices more often and are more likely to not dispose of personal data correctly.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>This study confirms that the smartphone users are lacking security training and provides some useful knowledge into how the security training and policies could be improved by considering the user from different demographics security related behaviour.</p>

		<p>In the unit 3 we have to submit an essay, and so during the unit 1 and 2 we have been asked to submit a brief essay outline for an informative feedback</p>
		<p>The essay of 800 words has to discuss three human factors and its implications on a fictional local healthcase institution, such as a local GP.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>This week's reading included the chapters 1 and 7 from the book by Johnson (2021), a paper on the on the human factors knowledge area (Sasse & Rashid, 2019), 
		a study on the unintentional insider threat (CERT, 2013) and a security breaches survey (UK DCMS, 2019).</p>
		<p>I really enjoyed the booking on the mind design and the concepts that it has introduced. For example, how human short and long term memory characteristics should be 
		considered when building an application and applying security to it. This was also repeated by the paper on human factors too.
		<br>
		Especially, the most interesting part was the analysis of the way humans think and store details and its impact on passwords. I never came to consider previously the burden 
		of having to store many very complicated passwords as a burden and the difficulty of replacing the old passwords with the new ones in the human long term memory. I have 
		never thought about the short term inability to read longer than 6 character OTP numbers either or remember multiple options on long recorded audio messages.
		<br>
		Since I work on application designs and defining the user interfaces when they are built, I find the human psychology aspect of application design very relevant and I look 
		forward to applying it in my future work.
		</p>
		<p>In addition to the reading, we also had to produce a blog post, prepare for next week's seminar and to submit a brief essay outline.</p>
		<p>I had submitted three esay briefs one after the other because I could not settle on the three human factors I wanted to discuss. I found it hard to determine which factors 
		are actually considered to be human factors. For example, the 'Stress' factor is often described in the research I read through as the work place related factors, however, 
		in my opinion, stress is not workplace factor only. Stress can result from many aspects of a person's life and all stress can impact security decission making.
		<br>
		Also, I felt like many factors are linked and they stem from each other and so this was a reason of making multiple submission edits.</p>
		<p>I enjoyed writing a blog post. They lay summary was a little like taking a notes of something you studied. The only difference was having to write these notes in a way 
		that the general public would understand.
		<br>
		I have done lay summaries before in my undergraduate studies, so it was a good refresher. However, it also helped me to better analyse and remember the article, since I had to 
		take the notes on it the whole time.</p>

		<p>This weeks reading included the chapters 2, 3 and 4 of the book by Johnson on the human mind and its impact on the software design.</p>
		<p>I have enjoyed learning on the Gestalt principles and I have realised that many of them I have already been using subconciously, however, knowing what they are and what 
		the intention behind these principles is will definitely help me when designing user interfaces. In addition, tips on grouping the data on the display and its benefits to 
		visually impaired users was extremelly useful and something I could definitely use in my current workplace. The information provided on the importance of using the correct 
		colours in your front end application has also been very helpful, specifically, with tips on how to improve the visibility to someone who is colour blind.</p>
		<p>During this week I have also received feedback from the tutor on my essay outline and there was some helpful feedback provided, such as I should not discuss the countermeasures 
		but instead work on discussing the implications of the human factors I chose to address.</p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>This unit aims to explore the user of mental models in identifying users pereceptions and secutiry preferences, to cover the use of mental models as an approach to 
	designing usable security, to review the contextual design process and how they are applied to usable security and to discuss the concept of accessibility and their

		<div class="content">
		<p>The Queens Medical Centre is a local community healthcare provider. It has recently installed an appointment and scheduling management information system (ASMIS) 
		to help it better manage the patient appointments. Whilst the system is considered secure by the clinic’s IT team, the management team is aware of the human factor 
		impact on the cyber security and would like this impact to be analysed and assessed.</p>
		<p>To be able to determine the applicable human factors and assess its impact, it is assumed that ASMIS is used by the patients and the clinic’s employees: administrative 
		staff, general practitioners, nurses, management, and IT teams. It is also assumed that the clinic’s staff has a higher system authorisation level than the patients, and 
		thus poses a higher threat. Because of it, the staff will be used as the primary source in this human factor impact analysis.</p>
		<p>When securing a system from cyber threats, the primary focus is often on the technology related countermeasures whilst the system users and their behaviour is often 
		ignored (Bowen et al, 2011). A 2021 (Critical Insights) report indicates that there were 45 million individuals in the US alone impacted by the healthcare data breaches 
		thus highlighting the need for a sociotechnical approach to cyber security rather than just the technical countermeasures (Malatji et al, 2019).</p>
		<p>Three human factors have been identified as of interest in terms of its impact in the healthcare system setup, namely: the human limitations and biases, workplace 
		related stress and pressure, and the varied risk perceptions.</p>
		<p>Many cyber-attacks, such as phishing, exploit human bias (Lyn Paul et al, 2019), thus, the confirmation and availability biases should be considered when creating a 
		security policy. A confirmation bias is a term that refers to the seeking of evidence which conforms to the existing beliefs (Nickerson, 1998). The availability bias, 
		on the other hand, refers to the decision making based on the small sample of data (Ting, 2022). The two biases combined can have a great impact on the security related 
		actions taken by the individuals as well as on those responsible for the Cyber Security policy design.</p>
		<p>For example, the medical centre staff may not log out of ASMIS after finishing their tasks, leave their machines unlocked whilst away from their desks, write down their 
		passwords or use weak passwords because of confirmation bias: the users tend to believe they are out of reach of a cyber-attacks just because they weren’t targeted 
		previously (Ting, 2022).</p>
		<p>When creating a new cyber security policy or user training, the management and IT teams may choose to emit what they deem to be less important security aspects and 
		focus on the countermeasures required to address the threats they have seen on the news instead, for example (Smith, 2012). Whilst these prioritised threats may be less 
		relevant to ASMIS, due to the availability bias, it can seem more important because of the person’s recent exposure to it.</p>
		<p>Another human factor which plays an important role in the overall success of the cyber security is stress and pressure. Recent data published by the HSE UK (2021) 
		has shown an increase in self-reported work-related stress and anxiety when compared to pre-coronavirus levels. A 2021 study (Gilleen) has further confirmed the high 
		levels of poor mental wellbeing of the UK healthcare staff. Various studies have demonstrated the linkage between the poor decision making and the level of stress 
		(Park, 2013; Michailidis & Banks, 2016; Tsiga et al, 2017) and provided clear evidence of the need to address this factor when designing a cyber security action plan.</p>
		<p>The burnout at work can result in the riskier behaviours, such as: sharing patient data with un-authorised colleagues or discussing it on social media, not reporting 
		cyber security breaches, absent-mindedly clicking on suspicious links in the emails (Fauzi et al, 2021), etc. Since the medical organisation capacity levels are reaching 
		an all-time high (Royal College of Nursing, 2021), work induced stress and pressure has an even greater impact on the security related decision making.</p>
		<p>The study by Fauzi et al (2021) has found a correlation between the stress and the changes in the risk perception, however, stress is not the only factor impacting our 
		attitudes towards the risk taking: frequent technology users tend to be higher risk takers (Öğütçü, 2016) and so do those who have not experienced a data breach or have 
		not received any education on the cyber security (Kostyuk & Wayne, 2019). In terms of ASMIS, the medical centre staff is likely to underestimate the threat of cyber 
		security risks should they receive no training on this subject. Equally, more experienced IT staff may underestimate the threats, having more false confidence in the 
		system.</p>
		<p>Peoples’ biases, risk perceptions and work-related stress are all intertwined and can have a significant impact on the overall systems’ security. Since computer systems 
		do not exist in a vacuum and interactions with people are unavoidable, it is of great importance to not only address the technical aspects of the cyber security, but also 
		the social ones.</p>

		<p>This unit's reading included chapters 8 to 11 of the book by Johnson (2021). The units spoke about our attention span, the recognition vs recall (and how the software 
		should be built so that the recall is invoked all the time if the application is meant to be used every day), problem solving and calculation requirements on the brain 
		and how much energy it requires (and hence we choose always an easier verified path so we don't need to think). It also touched on how we learn about things and how this 
		impacts the application design.
		<br>
		I have enjoyed reading all chapters of this book. I find it very interesting how just by accounting for our biology and the way we have developed over a 1000s of years, we can 
		make the applications and systems a lot more user friendly.
		</p>
		<p>During this unit I also had to submit my essay on the three chosen human factors. I really enjoyed writing the essay because as part of it, I had to conduct a lot of 
		research to be able to make a statement on each human factor and the research included reading some very interesting human pshychology articles. I have also noticed that my 
		writing style has improved a lot when compared to the initial units. I think it's partially due to all the academic material we have to read and whilst we are reading, we are 
		also learning about the style guidelines for academic writing.</p>
