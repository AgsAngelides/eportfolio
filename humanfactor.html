		<h3>Introduction to the module</h3>
		<p>It is popular to say that humans are the weakest link in the security and application success. This module aims to develop understanding on security risks and issues associated 
		to the human interactions with computing systems. It will also help develop the skills and knowledge required to manage and mitigate cyber risks in socio-technical systems.</p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>This unit aims to explore the human behaviour and its implications when designing the computing systems with respect to cyber security, discuss the human limitations and 
	capabilities and their impact on usable security, discuss the concept of insider threat.</p>
	
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Blog post - lay summary on the paper on the user behaviour on smartphones</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>Over the years, the smartphone popularity has only been growing. These devices now store large quantities of sensitive user data such as location information, 
		contacts, etc. and so it is important to protect it. To be able to secure the data, it is necessary to understand the smartphone user behaviour so that effective user 
		policies and training can be developed.</p>
		<p>The security issues in the smartphones can be introduced, among others, by insecure or unfriendly (malicious) applications installed by the user, the loss or theft of 
		the device, connections to insecure WIFIs, etc. There are many tools available to the user to help with these risks: mobile antivirus, backup tools, passwords, etc. 
		However, these tools may not be enough to protect the sensitive data if the actual user behaviour is unknown.</p>
		<p>To obtain more information on the smartphone user behaviour, an online survey was created and conducted on the users in China in 2016. Its aim was to find out more about 
		the user attitudes and actions towards the smartphone security and compare it against the demographic user data (user age, sex, occupancy, etc.).</p>
		<p>The 338 survey participants included both women and men, those with higher education as well as those working for private and public organisations.</p>
		<p>The survey analysed three aspects: the user behaviour related to security on their smartphones, the user behaviour when implementing security add-ons (passwords, 
		antivirus, etc) and the data backup related user actions.</p>
		<p>The survey had found that:
			<ul>
				<li>Less than 20% of users analyse the permissions needed by the application before installing it.</li>
				<li>More than 40% of users do not download applications from secure sources.</li>
				<li>Only 21% of users always log out of applications after using it.</li>
				<li>Over 40% of participants have clicked on links in emails prior to investigating it.</li>
				<li>Only 46% of users check for smartphone software updates.</li>
				<li>Most users connect to unsecure wifi occasionally.</li>
				<li>Backups are never or occasionally used by three quarters of the participants.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>The same survey has also shown that users are likely to install security related software on their smartphones such as antivirus, use screen locks and passwords and turn off their location services. However, over 40% of participant passwords were weak.</p>
		<p>The information provided by the users was then compared to the demographic user data (sex, age, etc).
			<ul>
				<li>Male smartphone are more likely to install risky application, however, they are also better of cleaning personal information from old devices and logging out of applications.</li>
				<li>Students are better at keeping their devices updated than those employed.</li>
				<li>Employed participants change their mobile devices more often and are more likely to not dispose of personal data correctly.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>This study confirms that the smartphone users are lacking security training and provides some useful knowledge into how the security training and policies could be improved by considering the user from different demographics security related behaviour.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>In the unit 3 we have to submit an essay, and so during the unit 1 and 2 we have been asked to submit a brief essay outline for an informative feedback</p>
		<p>The essay of 800 words has to discuss three human factors and its implications on a fictional local healthcase institution, such as a local GP.</p>

		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; Unit reflections</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p>This week's reading included the chapters 1 and 7 from the book by Johnson (2021), a paper on the on the human factors knowledge area (Sasse & Rashid, 2019), 
		a study on the unintentional insider threat (CERT, 2013) and a security breaches survey (UK DCMS, 2019).</p>
		<p>I really enjoyed the booking on the mind design and the concepts that it has introduced. For example, how human short and long term memory characteristics should be 
		considered when building an application and applying security to it. This was also repeated by the paper on human factors too.
		<br>
		Especially, the most interesting part was the analysis of the way humans think and store details and its impact on passwords. I never came to consider previously the burden 
		of having to store many very complicated passwords as a burden and the difficulty of replacing the old passwords with the new ones in the human long term memory. I have 
		never thought about the short term inability to read longer than 6 character OTP numbers either or remember multiple options on long recorded audio messages.
		<br>
		Since I work on application designs and defining the user interfaces when they are built, I find the human psychology aspect of application design very relevant and I look 
		forward to applying it in my future work.
		</p>
		<p>In addition to the reading, we also had to produce a blog post, prepare for next week's seminar and to submit a brief essay outline.</p>
		<p>I had submitted three esay briefs one after the other because I could not settle on the three human factors I wanted to discuss. I found it hard to determine which factors 
		are actually considered to be human factors. For example, the 'Stress' factor is often described in the research I read through as the work place related factors, however, 
		in my opinion, stress is not workplace factor only. Stress can result from many aspects of a person's life and all stress can impact security decission making.
		<br>
		Also, I felt like many factors are linked and they stem from each other and so this was a reason of making multiple submission edits.</p>
		<p>I enjoyed writing a blog post. They lay summary was a little like taking a notes of something you studied. The only difference was having to write these notes in a way 
		that the general public would understand.
		<br>
		I have done lay summaries before in my undergraduate studies, so it was a good refresher. However, it also helped me to better analyse and remember the article, since I had to 
		take the notes on it the whole time.</p>
