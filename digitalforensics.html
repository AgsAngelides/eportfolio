        <h1>Principles of Digital Forensics and Cyber Law</h1>
		<br>
		<h3>Introduction to the module</h3>
		<p>The aim of this module is to introduce us to the key aspects of law and legal system (all designed to be non-jurisdiction specific). We will also be introduced to 
		the principles of evidence collection and firensics analysis, different types of evidence and methods of evidence presentation, in terms of cyber security.</p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>In the Unit 1 of the module we are aiming to explore the implications and limitations concerning the cyber law, set the study of cyber forensics within the bigger context 
	of law enforcement and identify / evaluate academic arguments.</p>
	
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; e-Portfolio Activity 1: What is Law?</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p><b>Part 1</b>
		<br>
		<b>We have been asked to read the Connor (2019) article and to answer the following: what is the point that Gearty Connor is trying to make?
		<br>
		The author is highlighting the fact that despite all the changes in the world, including those of technology, the law is still the same thing as it was before: it is 
		based on rational thinking, on facts and that the law still matters to the world and it is still used by us to govern us.
		<br>
		We then had to read through Zeno-Zencovich’s book (2017) whilst focusing on the conclusion. When finished reading, we had to consider whether Zeno-Zencovich 
		convinced us of his argument. In particular, we have to reflect on whether the approach of eliminating the conceptual distinction between legal systems can 
		aid prevention and apprehension of cyber harm?</b>
		<br>
		The author does convince me on the benefit of getting rid of the law labels (civil law/common law) and just taking things for what they are. 
		I think the majority of the population does not distinguish between different types of law as is, and they are simply looking to correct the 
		unjust done to them. Also, for example, if a cybercrime is committed by a gruntled parent over a divorce against another parent, would this 
		fall under a family law or something else? The lines are now blurred more than ever and perhaps it no longer makes sense to put a case in one category or another.
		</p>
		<p><b>Part 2</b>
		<br>
		<b>Reflect on the above and consider (you might need to carry out some brief internet research) to what extent and how these arguments are reflected in your own 
		home country. Be prepared to share your findings (it will be helpful to have at least one example) in next week’s seminar.</b>
		<br>
		The Crown Prosecution Service (2022) in the UK provides some guidance on the Cyber Crime and where does it fit in within the UK law system. 
		If you read through the guidance, you see that all cyber crimes spill into all categories discussed by the Zeno-Zencovich such as the criminal law, 
		the family law, the public law, etc. In some cases, it may be hard to determine under which category it falls under and it could potentially belong to 
		both, for example many cyber crimes can fall under both the criminal and the public categories.

		<div class="content">
		<p>This week's reading included a chapter from the core book (Holt et al, 2022) and discussed things like the internet facilitating the development of subcultures to enable crime, 
		such as, enabling conversations on prostitution. Other items, I have not considered before, but perhaps heard of, were also discussed such as the website defacement. 
		It was also interesting to read about how due to the internet being so wide spread, it is difficult to enforce any kind of country specific laws. One thing may be illegal 
		in one country, but can be accessed online because it is allowed in another. In addition, I found the author's discussion on the contributors of the spread of the internet 
		crime eye opening. The reduction in IT equipment cost, internet access, the easyness with with one can commit a crime on the internet, have all encouraged the growth of the 
		cyber crime.</p>
		<p>A quick post on what is law (Conor, 2019) was also an interesting read on the author's opinion on where the law stands today and that it is still relevant. However, 
		I would disagree on the law always being based on facts. I think, in the new areas, where the judges are hearing a case for the first time that has never been addressed before, 
		there is bound to be bias based on what the judge nows. I think that perhaps the judges are the people who are trained well to overcome their biases, however, I don't think 
		that any of us can say we are completely unbiased.</p>
		<p>The lecturecast this week has summarised the cyber security challenges into 4 categories of Technical, Legal, Ethical and Operations. It also provided a good distinction 
		between the two types of cyber crime: the crime which can only be commited because technology enables it (e.g. ransomware) and a crime which is commited over the internet 
		but it is not limited to online only.</p>
		<p>This week we have also had to complete an e portfolio activity on the law categories overview and whether it still makes sense to categorise it, i.e. to split it into 
		crimilar, civil, family law, etc.
		<br>
		Authors within the reading list have provided some thought provoking ideas on how it no longer makes sense to split the law into the said categories because many crimes 
		now span across multiple areas and perhaps it is better to just take each case on the case per case basis. It was also suggested that we should perhaps start resarching 
		the how all these areas are interlinked and how those linkages can be addressed by the judges.
		<br>
		I have to agree with the authors that perhaps there is no need nowadays to strictly place each case in a category. It provides unecessary restrictions and potentially 
		limits the sentences each crime can be provided with just because it was placed in that category.
		<br>
		For example, how would one address a cyber crime which resulted in personal information stolen, as well as some financial and reputational loss, and the impact that it 
		could have had on someone's lives. These types of crimes are no longer just about, for example, loss in money, but there is a lot more involved.

		<p>This week's reading material provided an overview of the institutions responding to cyber crimes and how sometimes the same institutions are the ones violating it (Holt et al, 2022). It 
		also reviewed the steps that must be taken when preserving cyber evidence and reviewed two popular digital forensic imaging tools EnCase and FTK. It also explained how hashing 
		is used in verifying the imaged copy of the harddrive, which I found very interesting, since I have used hashing in the previous module for passwords, but was not aware of its 
		other uses such as image fingerprinting.</p>
