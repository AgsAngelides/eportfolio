		<h3>Introduction to the module</h3>
		<p>The aim of this module is to introduce us to the key aspects of law and legal system (all designed to be non-jurisdiction specific). We will also be introduced to 
		the principles of evidence collection and firensics analysis, different types of evidence and methods of evidence presentation, in terms of cyber security.</p>

	<h4><b>Unit overview</b></h4>
	<p>In the Unit 1 of the module we are aiming to explore the implications and limitations concerning the cyber law, set the study of cyber forensics within the bigger context 
	of law enforcement and identify / evaluate academic arguments.</p>
	
		<button type="button" class="collapsible"><b>&#9672; e-Portfolio Activity 1: What is Law?</b></button>
		<div class="content">
		<p><b>Part 1</b>
		<br>
		<b>We have been asked to read the Connor (2019) article and to answer the following: what is the point that Gearty Connor is trying to make?
		<br>
		The author is highlighting the fact that despite all the changes in the world, including those of technology, the law is still the same thing as it was before: it is 
		based on rational thinking, on facts and that the law still matters to the world and it is still used by us to govern us.
		<br>
		We then had to read through Zeno-Zencovich’s book (2017) whilst focusing on the conclusion. When finished reading, we had to consider whether Zeno-Zencovich 
		convinced us of his argument. In particular, we have to reflect on whether the approach of eliminating the conceptual distinction between legal systems can 
		aid prevention and apprehension of cyber harm?</b>
		<br>
		The author does convince me on the benefit of getting rid of the law labels (civil law/common law) and just taking things for what they are. 
		I think the majority of the population does not distinguish between different types of law as is, and they are simply looking to correct the 
		unjust done to them. Also, for example, if a cybercrime is committed by a gruntled parent over a divorce against another parent, would this 
		fall under a family law or something else? The lines are now blurred more than ever and perhaps it no longer makes sense to put a case in one category or another.
		</p>
		<p><b>Part 2</b>
		<br>
		<b>Reflect on the above and consider (you might need to carry out some brief internet research) to what extent and how these arguments are reflected in your own 
		home country. Be prepared to share your findings (it will be helpful to have at least one example) in next week’s seminar.</b>
		<br>
		The Crown Prosecution Service (2022) in the UK provides some guidance on the Cyber Crime and where does it fit in within the UK law system. 
		If you read through the guidance, you see that all cyber crimes spill into all categories discussed by the Zeno-Zencovich such as the criminal law, 
		the family law, the public law, etc. In some cases, it may be hard to determine under which category it falls under and it could potentially belong to 
		both, for example many cyber crimes can fall under both the criminal and the public categories.

		<div class="content">
		<p>This week's reading included a chapter from the core book (Holt et al, 2022) and discussed things like the internet facilitating the development of subcultures to enable crime, 
		such as, enabling conversations on prostitution. Other items, I have not considered before, but perhaps heard of, were also discussed such as the website defacement. 
		It was also interesting to read about how due to the internet being so wide spread, it is difficult to enforce any kind of country specific laws. One thing may be illegal 
		in one country, but can be accessed online because it is allowed in another. In addition, I found the author's discussion on the contributors of the spread of the internet 
		crime eye opening. The reduction in IT equipment cost, internet access, the easyness with with one can commit a crime on the internet, have all encouraged the growth of the 
		cyber crime.</p>
		<p>A quick post on what is law (Conor, 2019) was also an interesting read on the author's opinion on where the law stands today and that it is still relevant. However, 
		I would disagree on the law always being based on facts. I think, in the new areas, where the judges are hearing a case for the first time that has never been addressed before, 
		there is bound to be bias based on what the judge nows. I think that perhaps the judges are the people who are trained well to overcome their biases, however, I don't think 
		that any of us can say we are completely unbiased.</p>
		<p>The lecturecast this week has summarised the cyber security challenges into 4 categories of Technical, Legal, Ethical and Operations. It also provided a good distinction 
		between the two types of cyber crime: the crime which can only be commited because technology enables it (e.g. ransomware) and a crime which is commited over the internet 
		but it is not limited to online only.</p>
		<p>This week we have also had to complete an e portfolio activity on the law categories overview and whether it still makes sense to categorise it, i.e. to split it into 
		crimilar, civil, family law, etc.
		<br>
		Authors within the reading list have provided some thought provoking ideas on how it no longer makes sense to split the law into the said categories because many crimes 
		now span across multiple areas and perhaps it is better to just take each case on the case per case basis. It was also suggested that we should perhaps start resarching 
		the how all these areas are interlinked and how those linkages can be addressed by the judges.
		<br>
		I have to agree with the authors that perhaps there is no need nowadays to strictly place each case in a category. It provides unecessary restrictions and potentially 
		limits the sentences each crime can be provided with just because it was placed in that category.
		<br>
		For example, how would one address a cyber crime which resulted in personal information stolen, as well as some financial and reputational loss, and the impact that it 
		could have had on someone's lives. These types of crimes are no longer just about, for example, loss in money, but there is a lot more involved.

	<p>In the unit 2 of the digital forensics module we are exploring the implications and limitations concerning evidence, setting the study of cyber forensics within the bigger 
	context of law enforcement and identify and evaluating information to build up a case analysis.</p>

		<p>Virtual mobbing is usually a social media platform based cybercrime during which a group of persons comment on another person because of, for example, opposing views 
		(CPS, 2019), disability, religion, ethnics (Leymann, 1996), etc.</p>
		<p>The concept of Mobbing was first used in Sweden by a doctor to refer to group of children directing destructive behaviour towards another child (Leymann, 1996).</p>
		<p>Digital mobbing is not applicable to one group or an environment, and it has been observed in a workplace (Hladíková, 2020), professional education environment (Tura & 
		Yardibi, 2018) and schools (Fischer et al, 2020), however, most of the mobbing research appears to be related to adolescents.</p>
		<p>Mobbing, in this instance, refers to a long-term systematic humiliating, insulting, harassing of another person being targeted over a media platform (Uru & Gozukara, 
		2022). The mobbing, also sometimes referred to as cyber-bullying, can cause mental illness and other disorders and has been reported to result in many tragic events, 
		including suicides (Lush, 2013).</p>
		<p>Cyber mobbing purpose is similar to an offline, more traditional, bullying purpose: the aim is to harm another person, to humiliate them. Some aspects of the digital 
		mobbing vary when compared to its physical counterpart: the online mobbing is not restricted to in-person hours, it requires a device and a connection to the internet to 
		be successful, it allows for a larger group of people to participate in mobbing since it is no longer restricted to your community. However, since there is a trail of 
		evidence left on all devices and social platforms, it also makes it easier for the victims to prove their suffering.</p>
		<p>Some statistics in Canada also paint an interesting picture of how the traditional and cyber bullying overlap; it has been found that physical bullying declines as a 
		person ages, whilst the cyber bullying/mobbing increases and peaks around ages 11 to 15 (prevent, 2022).</p>
		<p>According to the UK CPS guidance, whether a crime is being committed by mobbing depends on a variety of factors, such as whether there is a credible threat involved, 
		whether it is very offensive, indecent or if, for example, it is targeting an individual in a way which constitutes as harassment or stalking (CPS, 2019). Whilst the 
		cyber mobbing is not a crime on its own, depending on the mobbing it may fall under a variety of laws within the UK.</p>
		<p>Online mobs could be prosecuted in the UK under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 since it is a criminal offence to harass another person regardless of where the 
		harassment takes place (legislation.gov.uk, 1997).</p>
		<p>The Malicious Communications Act of 1988 (legislation.gov.uk, 1988) and the Communications Act of 2003 (legislation.go.uk, 2003) are two other laws under which cyber 
		mobbing is also a criminal offence.</p>
		<p>If the virtual mobbing is happening at a work place, the Health and Safety Act of 1974 can be used to prosecuted the offenders (legislation.gov.uk, 1974).</p>
		<p>Virtual mobbing could also be prosecuted under the civil laws in the UK. A good example of this is the case of Johnson vs Steele where a man was awarded £70,000 in 
		damages over the online bullying conducted against him on Twitter by another person (Bailii, 2014).</p>
		<p>Depending on whether there was a criminal offence committed or a civil one, the burden of proof will lie with a different person. If you were to sue a person(s) over 
		virtual mobbing to some damages, you would have to be the one to prove the damage done in civil court (Holt et al, 2022). If the UK was to sue you over the criminal 
		offences committed, it would it up the Crown prosecution services in the UK to prove you have committed the crimes (Holt et al, 2022).</p>

		<p>Walden discusses how the rise in the cyber crime is having an impact on the balance between the right to investigate a crime and a right of privacy of a user, an 
		organisation, service provider etc. And so, the author reviews particular instances where they feel this balance was achieved, such as having to pay for a personal 
		data when conducting the investigation to ensure unnecessary requests are avoided or having to obtain a warrant for search on devices before carrying out the search.</p>
		<p>I agree with the authors assessment that the balance has shifted towards the law enforcement vs the individual rights in the recent times. For example, the Amnesty 
		International (2020) is pursuing a court case against the UK government over what appears to be a mass spying programme Tempora conducted by the GCHQ without, what appears 
		to be, the governments consent or the knowledge of the country’s citizens.</p>
		<p>Bryant & Kennedy (2014) in their paper go on to talk about how the investigation has moved away from trying to convict someone to trying to find the truth instead, i.e. 
		the pursuit of information regardless of whether it points towards or away from the suspect. According to the paper, the law and policing were closely connected, because 
		the miscarriages of justice performed by the police were used to enact new laws to ensure this does not happen again. For example, so that the police does not choose how 
		they build a case or search for evidence or pick a suspect, but rather follow the guidelines as pert the law.</p>
		<p>Although the authors talk about the state of policing many years ago, this relationship between the law and policing still applies today. The crimes are changing, and 
		the tools used to commit these crimes. Many of the existing laws are no longer suitable to guide the law enforcement along the investigation and convictions, and so the 
		police is often required to conduct the investigation based on what they think is right. Then, the mistakes made by the police may come up in a court case, which will set 
		a precedent and will create new laws on how the same action should be carried out next time.</p>

		<div class="content">
		<p>Much of this week's reading (Holt et al, 2022; Valjarević & Venter, 2015) focused on the forensic investigation techniques and the considerations (ethical and others) that the professional should have. It appears 
		that whilst some of the processes exist on how to investigate digital evidence, a lot of it is derived from the physical evidence investigation techniques which is not 
		always suitable. Another difficulty is with presenting such digital evidence: both the legal professionals and the juries lack the understanding and thus may not treat 
		digital evidence seriously.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, I found the concept of the 'Readiness' stage of the forensic investigation process interesting and useful. It's just a step to make sure that the organisations 
		actually have the data stored in such way that it would enable the investigation without extra cost or impact on the business and it is interesting that I haven't seen this step 
		in other literatures before. However, I would argue, that this is not an investigation part of process, but should rather part of internal organisation cyber policies.</p>
		<p>Another important point made by the authors of one of the papers (Casey et al, 2009) was the need for a standardised system for assessing and evaluating cyber evidence promptly so not to delay 
		the justice. Current lead times on evidence investigation due to the large volumes are too long for the justice system to work efficiently.</p>
		<p>This unit made me question how well any country is prepared for handling any type of cyber crime. We live in a reactive world at the moment where things are changing so fast 
		due to technological advances, that the there is not enough time to create new laws or update the existing ones to account for all the new types of crimes that exist and all the 
		new ways it can be executed. So we are moving away from having laws written down which apply to the majority of the situations to assessing them on a case per case basis and 
		setting the precedents for the future cases to come. Which means, that we are more and more reliant on the judges judgement and we can only hope that the judges who are now the 
		main law enactors have the all the ethics, morals and technical knowledge to ensure the right decisions are made.</p>

		during which the chain of custody is essential and highlights the fact that it’s often viewed as a procedural burden rather than part of the evidence.
		<br>
		<br>
		The problems discussed by Holt et al (2015) are all related to understanding the mind of the criminal. Holt analyses the problem of not having good theoretical models of 
		providing the insight on cyber-criminal behaviour. Understanding how the criminal thinks, can help to determine the best way to collect the evidence and the best way to 
		deter the criminal actions in the first place.
		<br><br>
		For example, if the investigators know the cyber criminals are more likely to come from certain environment, they could use that knowledge to narrow down the list of 
		suspects.

		<p><b>Read Sunde and Dror (2019): and answer the following question: What are the issues raised in the article, and how these might affect further the validity and 
		collection of evidence?</b>
		<br><br>
		The paper by Sunder and Dror (2019) reflects on the issue of not having robust procedures for ensuring that the digital evidence is forensically sound and conducted to 
		the highest scientific standards to ensure it does not contribute to wrongful convictions of innocent people. The authors discuss the issues that arise from the 
		technology related errors as well as human and cognitive errors, placing the focus on the human related ones.
		<br><br>
		Specifically, the authors look into how three different types of the cognitive bias can impact the forensic specialist judgement: anchoring bias, availability bias and 
		confirmation bias.
		<br><br>
		Other factors impacting the evidence relation discussed by the authors are environment, culture, experience, training, organisational, base rate expectations, irrelevant 
		case information, reference material and case evidence.
		<br><br>
		All these factors which impact the cognitive bias can result in the evidence pointing to the wrong person and encourage bad evidence investigation practices which can in 
		turn lead to wrongful convictions in court.

		<p>In the module of the 'Human factors' within this degree we have analysed how these factors impact the cyber security from how people perceive the threat to how the 
		security tools and policies are implemented. This unit of the forensics module has expanded on the previous module by showing the cognitive biases also impact the 
		digital forensics evidence analysys. It is scary to think that the digital forensics has become the main type of evidence analysis technique in many of the most 
		recent cases, however, the procedures and policies for how this is conducted do not exist or are at the very beginning of being developed. This can have a huge effect 
		on the verdicts of many convictions and does not support the guarantee of fair trial.</p>
		<p>The discussion forum summary post was also due this week. None of the arguments posted by my peers convinced me that the motivation behind the cybercrime is different to 
		the regular crime. I could not find any of other corroborating research either. I think that perhaps the author's article was more of an opinion piece and perhaps the lack 
		of other research to support this author's views contributed to the multitude of critique from my peers. Overal, I think the author's main point still stands: the cybercrime 
		motivation is the same as any other crime.</p>

		<p>In this unit we have been introduced to the concept of the cyber victim and the theories behind what contributes towards becoming a cyber victim of various cyber 
		crimes. Many of the articles written on the cyber crimes concentrate on the moneratory loss and only dicuss other impact on victims when that impact results in a tragic 
		event such as a suicide. The Holt et al (2022) presented a vary good overview of how the people themselves increase their 'attack surface', if I can call that, 
		by using certain platforms, performing certain operations online, sharing more personal information than necessary.</p>
		<p>Whilst I do think that if victimisation was paid more attention, it could turn into victim blaming very quickly which is not the right thing to do at all, understanding 
		what makes some of us at a higher risk of a cyber crime is important to ensure that we all can take appropriate measures to reduce this risk.</p>

		<p>Some interesting concepts were reviewed during this unit. For example, the public perception of cybercrime and its impact on the policy making (Jewkes & Yar, 2011). I have noticed a rise 
		of policies aiming to protect children from the dangers on the internet in school, public and home settins. The parental control tools have become very popular. The schools 
		filter a lot of internet content and only allow access to websites needed for education. However, this fear does not appear to be based on any statistical data and only on  a 
		few cases which received a lot of press coverage. The implication being, in my opinion, that childrens' development and enagement could be restricted to it, never mind, the child's 
		right to privacy. For example, many parental applications monitor every message sent from the child's mobile device, and some parents I know, go even as far as installing it 
		without their children's knowledge. I think it is important for children to make mistakes and to trust them to a certain extent, and this obsessivenes over protecting children 
		from an over exaggerated level of threat is potentially causing some harm to the children along the way.</p>
		<p>The first assignment for this module was also due this week. I have really enjoyed researching various aspects of the Image based sexual abuse cybercrime within the UK, including 
		the laws, digital forensics challenges, history, etc. The most concerning part of the research that I have come across, was the fact that the regulatory bodies and law enforcement 
		cannot keep up with the technology and that the laws are so short sighted in some cases. Perhaps I am looking through slightly rosy glassed, but it seems to me that it should not take 
		this long to add a new ammendment to the law here and there as the new things come to light. I think the law creators must move over to using a more agile approach in the law updates.</p>

		<p>A smart motorway is a motorway where technology is used to manage the traffic by decreasing congestions and increasing the capacity. It aims to improve the 
		infrastructure without damaging the surrounding environment and it is an economically viable option since it doesn’t require for the roads to be widened (Jallow et al, 
		2019). The first smart motorway was introduced to the UK in 2006 on the M42 and there are currently 14 smart motorways in operation today (Allan, 2022).</p>
		<p>Whilst it would appear that the new type of motorway provides many benefits without incurring large costs, it has recently become one of the most debated topics within 
		the UK.</p>
		<p>The latest example of the ‘technology management’ gone wrong in terms of smart motorways was from the 28th of October in 2022, when the smart system malfunctioned and 
		resulted in incorrect lane closures, wrong speeds and extremely bright variable speed signs blinding the drivers on a night drive (BBC, 2022), potentially endangering the 
		drivers’ lives.</p>
		<p>The smart motorway signage must be followed by all drivers at all times as it is legally enforceable (rac, 2022), this includes the speed limits and lane closures. 
		However, what happens in the instance of the smart system malfunction as the one which happened in the UK recently? The Universal Declaration of Human rights (GRSP, 2017) 
		and the UK Human Rights Act 1998 (Citisens Advice, 2022) both protect the person’s right to life, however, a faulty smart motorway system, the lack of hard shoulders and 
		the UK driving laws enforcing the smart motorways driving suggestions endanger it.</p>
		<p>There are several civil cases involving National Highways currently taking place where the families of the smart motorway victims are trying to get the justice for 
		their loved ones and get the hard shoulders reinstated (irwinmitchell, 2022). As a result of these lawsuits, the rollout of new smart motorways has been paused. Hence, 
		within the UK, the civil court can be used to protect the rights of the UK residents.</p>
